{"question": "How does the Lµ−Lτ extension of the Standard Model address important open issues in particle physics and what is being investigated in this study?", "answer": "The Lµ−Lτ extension of the Standard Model gauges the difference of the leptonic muon and tau number, giving rise to a new vector boson, the Z′. This model is potentially able to address important open issues in particle physics, including the anomalies in the b→sµ+µ−decays reported by the LHCb experiment, the anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g−2)µ, and dark matter phenomenology if extra matter is charged under Lµ−Lτ. In this study, the specific invisible decay topology e+e−→µ+µ−Z′, Z′→invisible, where the Z′ production occurs via radiation off a final state muon, is being investigated for the first time. The decay branching fractions (BF) to neutrinos are predicted to vary between 33% and 100% depending on the Z′ mass. This model is poorly constrained at low masses, and the search is the first to have some sensitivity to Z′ masses mZ′ < 2mµ. The second scenario being considered postulates the existence of a lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) boson, either a scalar or a vector, which couples to leptons. The presence of LFV mediators can be constrained by measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry in e+e−→µ+µ−, and a direct, model-independent search of e+e−→e±µ∓Z′, Z′→invisible is presented. The analysis uses events with exactly two tracks, identified as µµ or eµ, and minimal other activity in the ECL. The dominant backgrounds are SM final states with missing energy and two tracks identified as leptons. Control samples are used to check background rates predicted by simulation and to infer correction factors and related uncertainties. Upper limits on the standard Z′ cross section are computed with a counting technique in windows of the recoil mass distribution. For the LFV Z′ model-independent search, upper limits are interpreted in terms of signal efficiency times cross section.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-001", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}

This selection is applied in the context of physics only for recoil masses below 3 GeV/c². This selection is used to exclude inefficient regions where photons from radiative backgrounds can escape undetected.

{"question": "How is the recoil mass resolution obtained and used in the analysis of Z' events in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "The recoil mass resolution is obtained by fitting each Z' recoil mass distribution with a sum of a Crystal Ball (CB) and a Gaussian function with coincident peaks. The resolution is then computed as the sum in quadrature of the CB and Gaussian widths, weighted according to their contributions. This resolution is used to define mass windows of width ±2σ, where σ is the recoil mass resolution. The width of these windows varies from 1150 MeV/c2 at MZ' = 0.5 GeV/c2 to a minimum of 51 MeV/c2 at MZ' = 6.9 GeV/c2. There are a total of 69 mass windows below 8 GeV/c2. Studies with radiative muon pair events indicate that the recoil mass widths for data and simulation are consistent, and no systematic uncertainty is assigned. A final selection, called 'τ suppression', is then applied to further suppress τ+τ- events by exploiting the kinematics of the Z' production.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-001", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

The tracking efficiency for data is compared to simulation using radiative Bhabha and e+e−→τ +τ − events, and differences of 10% for two-track ﬁnal states are found. A 0.90 correction factor is applied to simulation, with a 4% systematic uncertainty due to kinematic dependencies. In the e±µ∓ analysis, the trigger efficiency is (96 ± 1)%, and the tracking efficiency is the same as in the µ+µ− analysis with a 4% systematic uncertainty.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-001", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "What is the procedure used to look for anomalies in the µ+µ− sample and compute 90% credibility level upper limits on the standard Z′ cross section?", "answer": "In the given content, the procedure to look for anomalies in the µ+µ− sample involves calculating the probability for each recoil mass window to obtain a yield greater than or equal to the yield obtained in data, given the predicted background. This calculation includes both statistical and systematic uncertainties. No anomalies were observed, with all results below 3σ local significance in both the normal and shifted-binning options. A Bayesian procedure was then used to compute 90% credibility level (CL) upper limits on the standard Z′ cross section. Flat priors were assumed for all positive values of the cross section, while Poissonian likelihoods were assumed for the number of observed and simulated events. Gaussian smearing was used to model the systematic uncertainties. The results were cross-checked with log-flat priors and with a frequentist procedure based on the Feldman-Cousins approach and were found to be compatible. Finally, the cross section results were translated into 90% CL upper limits on the coupling constant g′.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-001", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}
