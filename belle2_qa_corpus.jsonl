{"question": "What is a summary of the Belle II experiment performed at the SuperKEKB collider in 2018 to search for the invisible decay of a Z' and a lepton-flavor-violating Z'?", "answer": "The Belle II experiment conducted a search for the invisible decay of a Z' and a lepton-flavor-violating Z' using data collected in 2018 at the SuperKEKB collider. The search was performed in the process of e+e−→µ+µ−Z' and e+e−→e±µ∓Z'.

{"question": "How does the Lµ−Lτ extension of the Standard Model (SM) explain important open issues in particle physics and what is the significance of the 'invisible decay topology' in this context?", "answer": "The Lµ−Lτ extension of the SM is a theory that gauges the difference of the leptonic muon and tau number, resulting in a new vector boson called the Z′. This Z′ couples only to the SM through the µ, τ, νµ and ντ, with coupling constant g′. The Lµ−Lτ model has the potential to address important open issues in particle physics, including the anomalies in the b →sµ+µ−decays reported by the LHCb experiment, the anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g−2)µ, and dark matter phenomenology if extra matter is charged under Lµ−Lτ. The 'invisible decay topology' e+e−→µ+µ−Z′, Z′ →invisible, where the Z′ production occurs via radiation off a final state muon, is a specific decay topology that is poorly constrained at low masses in this model. This decay topology is significant because it allows for the possibility of the Z′ decaying into a pair of dark matter particles, which is not constrained by existing measurements.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-001", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are events simulated and selected in the Z' search and Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) Z' search experiments at Belle II?", "answer": "In the Z' search experiment at Belle II, events are simulated using the KKMC generator for e+e−→τ+τ−(γ), TAUOLA for τ decays, and Geant4 for detector geometry and particle interactions. The trigger used is the CDC two-track trigger, which selects events with at least two tracks with an azimuthal opening angle larger than 90°. To reject Bhabha scatterings, spurious tracks, and beam-induced background, events are required to pass certain selection criteria. These criteria include having 'good' tracks with transverse and longitudinal projections of the distance of closest approach with respect to the interaction point smaller than 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively. Photons are classified as ECL clusters with energy greater than 100 MeV, which are not associated with tracks. In the LFV Z' search experiment, the trigger used is the ECL trigger, which selects events with total energy in the barrel and part of the endcap above 1 GeV. The same selection criteria for tracks and photons are applied as in the Z' search experiment.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-001", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How is the background for recoil masses below 7 GeV/c2 suppressed in the analysis of Z' production events in e+e- collisions?", "answer": "In the analysis of Z' production events in e+e- collisions, backgrounds for recoil masses below 7 GeV/c2 are suppressed using several selection criteria. After initial selections, the background is dominated by e+e- → τ+τ-(γ) events with τ → µ or τ → π where the pion is misidentified as a muon. To further suppress these events, a final selection called 'τ suppression' is applied, which exploits the kinematics of Z' production. This selection involves defining variables in the center-of-mass frame, such as the transverse recoil momentum with respect to the lepton with the higher momentum (pT,lmaxrec), the transverse recoil momentum with respect to the lower momentum (pT,lminrec), and the transverse momentum of the dilepton pair (pTµµ or pTeµ). A linear cut is then imposed in the pT,lmaxrec – pT,lminrec plane, and a simultaneous selection pTµµ > pTcut is applied, where the cut values are determined using an optimization procedure that maximizes the Figure of Merit (FOM) in each recoil mass window. The cut value for pTcut is typically 1.5-2.0 GeV/c and is effective in suppressing the remaining µ+µ−(γ) and e+e−µ+µ− backgrounds. For masses higher than 7 GeV/c2, signal and background overlap, making further suppression challenging.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-001", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "What are the key features of the Bhabha and digamma processes, and why are they suitable for integrated luminosity measurements in the Belle II detector?", "answer": "The Bhabha and digamma processes are important in particle physics due to their large production rates, accurate theoretical predictions for cross sections, and simple event topologies. These features make it possible to simulate and select events with high precision and nearly no background contamination. Consequently, statistical and systematic uncertainties are reduced, making these processes ideal for integrated luminosity measurements. In the context of the Belle II detector, the Bhabha and digamma processes are used to study the decays of B mesons, charmed particles, tau leptons, Upsilon(nS) (n = 1,2...6) resonances, and the production of new states of matter. The detector operates at the SuperKEKB accelerator, which provides higher luminosity and a different coordinate system compared to the KEKB accelerator. The Belle II detector surrounds the interaction point and consists of several sub-detectors, including the VXD, CDC, and ECL, which are crucial for measuring luminosity in Bhabha and digamma events. However, due to limited VXD acceptance and low CDC tracking efficiency in Phase 2, luminosity measurements using ECL information alone are presented in this paper, focusing only on the ECL barrel region.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-002", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How does the uncertainty in energy and polar angle range of electrons, positrons, and photons affect the measured integrated luminosities in the BabaYaga@NLO generator?", "answer": "The uncertainty in energy is checked by repeating the measurements with the center-of-mass (CM) energy increased or decreased by 0.1%. The larger of the changes in the integrated luminosity is taken as the associated uncertainty, which is about 0.2% for both measurements. The impact of the uncertainty of the CM energy spread is negligible due to the slow variation of Bhabha and digamma processes with energy. The polar angle range of electrons and positrons for Bhabha events or photons for digamma events in the CM frame is another important input to the BabaYaga@NLO generator. The nominal signal MC samples are generated in the θcm range 35°–145°. Repeating the measurements with Bhabha and digamma events generated in the wider θcm range 5°–175°, the results for Bhabha-dominant measurements are consistent within the statistical uncertainties. However, for digamma-dominant measurements, the result changes by about 0.4%, which is taken as the relative systematic uncertainty. The actual position of the interaction point (IP) may deviate from the nominal position (0, 0, 0) as assumed in the MC simulation. A preliminary study with charged tracks determines the average position and the width of the IP distribution over the whole data sample to be (−0.4, 0.4, 0.3) mm. Repeating the measurements using a shifted position of the IP in the MC simulation, the results change by about 0.2% and 0.1% for Bhabha-dominant and digamma-dominant measurements, respectively. The impact of the IP spread is found to be negligible on the measured integrated luminosities.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2019-002", "page": 8, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How are photon candidates selected and analyzed in the Belle II experiment using Geant4 and the Belle II software framework?\",\n\"answer\": \"In the Belle II experiment, photon candidates are selected using a series of criteria designed to maximize the Punzi figure of merit for 5 σ discovery. These criteria include requiring at least three photon candidates with energy Eγ above 0.65 GeV (for ma > 4 GeV/c2) or 1.0 GeV (for ma ≤4 GeV/c2), and selecting the three most energetic photons if there are more than three that pass the selection criteria. Photon detection times are required to be compatible with the average weighted photon time, and the invariant mass of the three-photon system must satisfy 0.88√s ≤Mγγγ ≤1.03√s to eliminate kinematically unbalanced events. A θγ separation between any two photons of ∆θγ > 0.014 rad, or an azimuthal angle separation of ∆φγ > 0.400 rad is also required to reduce background from photon conversions outside of the tracking detectors. A loose selection based on a multivariate shower-shape classifier is applied to the most isolated of the three photons to reduce the number of clusters produced by neutral hadrons and by particles that do not originate from the interaction point. The resulting M 2recoil and M 2γγ distributions are shown in Fig. 1 together with the stacked contributions from the luminosity-normalized simulated samples of SM backgrounds.

The fits are performed in the range 0.2 < ma < 6.85 GeV/c^2 for the M^2_γγ spectrum, and in the range 6.85 < ma < 9.7 GeV/c^2 for the M^2_{recoil} spectrum. There are 100 bins used for each fit range. The selection efficiency is not associated with any systematic uncertainty. The signal probability density function (PDF) has two components: a peaking contribution from correctly reconstructed signal photons and a combinatorial-background contribution from the other two combinations of photons. The peaking contribution is modeled using a Crystal Ball (CB) function. The resolution of M^2_γγ worsens with increasing ma, while that of M^2_{recoil} improves with increasing ma.

{"question": "How are the combinatorial background contributions and photon-energy resolution accounted for in the analysis of diphoton recoil and mass distributions?", "answer": "In the analysis of diphoton recoil and mass distributions, combinatorial background contributions from the wrong combinations of photons in signal events are taken into account by adding a mass-dependent, one-dimensional, smoothed kernel density estimation (KDE) PDF obtained from signal simulation. The ﬁts are performed in steps of ma that correspond to half the CB width (σCB) for the respective squared mass, and CB signal parameters are interpolated between the known simulated masses. The KDE shape is taken from the simulation sample generated with the closest value of ma to that assumed in the ﬁt. The photon-energy resolution in simulation is about 3% for Eγ = 0.65 GeV and improves to about 2% for Eγ > 1 GeV. However, it is found that the photon energy resolution in simulation is better than that in data by at most 30% at low energies. Therefore, an energy-dependent additional resolution smearing is applied to the simulated signal samples before determining the CB resolution parameter σCB.

The polynomial parameters were not fixed by simulation, but were instead free parameters of each data fit. Each fit was performed in a mass range corresponding to -20 σCB to +30 σCB for M2γγ, and -25 σCB to +25 σCB for M2recoil, and was constrained between M2γγ > 0 GeV2/c4 and M2recoil < 100.5 GeV2/c4. The choice of fit range and polynomial order was optimized based on various conditions, including providing a reduced χ2 close to one, giving locally smooth fit results, and being consistent with minimal variations between adjacent fit ranges. The signal significance was calculated as the smallest of all signal significance values determined from each background model, and the local significance including systematic uncertainties was given by S = p2 ln(L/Lbkg), where L is the maximum likelihood for the fit and Lbkg is the likelihood for a fit to the background-only hypothesis. The observed upper limits on the cross section σa were computed using a one-sided frequentist profiled-likelihood method, and were reported as the least stringent of all 95% C.L. upper limits determined from the variations of background model and fit range.

The measured value of φ3 is (78.4 ± 11.4 ± 0.5 ± 1.0)◦, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is the experimental systematic uncertainty and the third is from the uncertainties on external measurements of the D-decay strong-phase parameters.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-001", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "What is the significance of the angle φ3 in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity triangle and why is it important to improve the direct determination of this angle?", "answer": "The angle φ3, also known as γ, is a key parameter in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) unitarity triangle, which describes CP violation within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. It is defined as φ3 ≡ arg(−VudV ∗ub/VcdV ∗cb), where Vqq′ are CKM matrix elements. The angle is measurable via the interference of the tree-level quark transitions ¯b → ¯cu¯s and ¯b → ¯uc¯s, which have negligible theoretical uncertainties. Therefore, the measurement of φ3 provides a test of the SM when compared to indirect determinations, which are derived from independent measurements of the sides and other angles of the unitarity triangle and can be influenced by beyond-the-SM particles via loop amplitudes. The world-average value of the direct measurements of φ3 is (66.2+3.4 −3.2)◦, while the indirect determination is (63.4 ± 0.9)◦. Improvement in the direct determination of φ3 is required to better constrain possible beyond-the-SM contributions to CP violation.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-001", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"Can you explain how the world average for the measurement of φ3 is determined using B+ →DK0Sh+h− decays and the model-dependent and model-independent methods?\",\n\"answer\": \"Sure! The world average for the measurement of φ3 is dominated by a result reported by the LHCb collaboration that uses measurements of direct CP violation in the decays B+ →DK0Sh+h−, where D is either a D0 or ¯D0 and h is a pion or kaon. The interference between ¯b →¯cu¯s and ¯b →¯uc¯s arises because the D0 or ¯D0 decay to the same K0Sh+h− final state. There are two approaches to determine φ3 from B+ →DK0Sh+h− decays: model-dependent and model-independent methods. The model-dependent method relies on a detailed description of the intermediate-resonance structure of the D-decay amplitude. On the other hand, the model-independent method uses CP-asymmetry measurements in disjoint regions of the D-decay phase space that can then be related to φ3 using measurements of D-decay strong-phase parameters determined by the CLEO and BESIII collaborations. The model-independent method is preferred due to the removal of potentially large and difficult-to-determine systematic uncertainties from the assumptions of the amplitude model, which are unavoidable in the model-dependent method. These model-dependent uncertainties have been estimated to be between 3° to 9°. In this paper, the authors report a model-independent measurement of φ3 using B+ →DK0Sh+h− decays produced in asymmetric e+e− collisions at a center-of-mass energy corresponding to the mass of the Υ(4S) resonance. The data sample used corresponds to integrated luminosities of 711 fb−1 and 128 fb−1 accumulated by the Belle and Belle II experiments, respectively. This result is the first obtained from a combined analysis of Belle and Belle II data.

{"question": "How is the analysis of B+ →Dh+ decays in Belle and Belle II data sets performed to determine CP-violating observables using a model-independent approach?", "answer": "The analysis involves selecting samples of B+ →Dh+ decays, including B+ →Dπ+ and B+ →DK+, where the latter is a control sample. An unbinned maximum likelihood fit is then performed on the combined sample of B+ →Dh+ candidates to determine CP-violating observables and nuisance parameters, reducing dependence on simulated data. The ﬁt is applied to data categorized in several ways, including by the bin in which they are reconstructed in the D-decay Dalitz plot. To be model-independent, the ﬁt relies on strong-phase parameters of the D decay measured in each of these bins, taken as external inputs. The CP-violating observables are then interpreted as constraints on φ3 and hadronic parameters related to the B-decay amplitude. Analysis procedures are devised and validated on simulated samples before being applied to data to avoid experimental bias. The two interfering decays sensitive to φ3 are B+ →¯D0K+ and B+ →D0K+, where the latter is both CKM- and colour-suppressed compared to the former, and their amplitudes are given by equation (2.1) in the content.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-001", "page": 7, "chunk_type": "text"}

(2.1)) by substituting φ3 →−φ3 and AD(m2−, m2+)←→A ¯D(m2−, m2+). In the model-independent method, the D-decay Dalitz plot is divided into 2 × N bins, which are indexed from i = −N to i = N with i = 0 excluded. The bins are defined symmetrically about the line m2+ = m2− such that if a point (m2−, m2+) lies within bin i, then the point (m2+, m2−) lies within bin −i. The strong phase of the D0-decay amplitude at a point (m2−, m2+) is written as δD(m2−, m2+). The D-amplitude-weighted average of the cosine of the strong-phase difference between D0 and ¯D0 decays within bin i is defined as ci, which is given by the equation: ci = (1/Ri) ∫(AD(m2−, m2+)A ¯D(m2+, m2−) cos(δD(m2−, m2+) - δD(m2+, m2−)) - AD(m2+, m2−)A ¯D(m2−, m2+) cos(δD(m2+, m2−) - δD(m2−, m2+))) dm2−dm2+, where the integral is over the i-th bin.

{"question": "How does the Belle analysis determine the values of Fi in the study of B+ → Dh+ decays?", "answer": "In the Belle analysis, the values of Fi are determined simultaneously from a fit to the B+ → Dh+ candidates. This approach has the advantage of including the φ3 sensitivity from B+ → Dπ+ in the determination of xDK± and yDK±, and improving the fit stability. Additionally, this method removes a source of systematic uncertainty compared to the previous analysis in Ref. [20], which determined the values of Fi from a sample of D∗+ → D0π+ decays. The kinematic properties of the B+ → Dπ+ and D∗+ → D0π+ decays resulted in different acceptance functions for the two samples, which was a source of systematic uncertainty. The analysis uses two binning schemes, one for B+ → D0K0Sh+ decays and another for B+ → D0K0SK+K− h+ decays, with the number of bins determined based on the statistical sensitivity and fit stability of the data. The measurements of ci and si ignore the effects of D-mixing and assume CP-conservation in D decay. Ignoring these effects in the strong-phase and model-independent B+ → D0K0Sh+h− h+ analyses results in negligible bias. The potential bias of ignoring K0 CP-violation and regeneration has been studied and found to be negligible compared to the current statistical precision.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-001", "page": 9, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How are charged particles identified as kaons or pions in the Belle and Belle II experiments?", "answer": "In the Belle and Belle II experiments, charged particles (π+ and K+) are identified as kaons or pions by using the information from various subdetectors such as the Central Drift Chamber (CDC), the aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters, and time-of-flight scintillation counters in Belle, and all subdetectors in Belle II, with the information from CDC, TOP, and ARICH being the most significant. A likelihood ratio RK/π = L(K)/[L(K) + L(π)] is calculated, where L(h) is the likelihood for the particle h to produce the observed particle-identification signal associated with the track. For separating kaons from pions coming directly from B+ → Dh+ decays, a requirement of L(K/π) > 0.6 is used. The kaon-identification efficiency is 84% (79%) and the probability of a pion being misidentified as a kaon is 8% (7%) in Belle [43] (Belle II) data. A less restrictive requirement of L(K/π) > 0.2 is applied to kaons used to reconstruct the D → K0S K+K− candidates, which suppresses the K-π misidentification rate while maintaining high efficiency.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-001", "page": 11, "chunk_type": "text"}

Partially reconstructed B+ → D(∗)K(∗)+ decays, which peak at lower ∆E values, are excluded from the analysis by choosing an asymmetric ∆E window. \\n\\nThe dominant background comes from e+e−→q¯q events, which are suppressed by using the difference in topology with respect to e+e−→Υ(4S) →B ¯B decays.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties calculated in the analysis of B+ →Dπ+, B−→Dπ−, B+ →DK+, and B−→DK− decays in the Belle data set?", "answer": "In the analysis of B+ →Dπ+, B−→Dπ−, B+ →DK+, and B−→DK− decays in the Belle data set, systematic uncertainties are calculated using several strategies. The systematic uncertainties related to Particle Identification (PID) are calculated by varying the efficiency and misidentification rates within their uncertainty, independently for Belle and Belle II. To estimate the effect of ignoring the charmless peaking background, the fits are repeated with a fixed peaking background component normalized to the yields found in the sideband studies. The resulting bias in the central values of the physics parameters is considered as a systematic uncertainty. Fit biases are investigated using linearity tests, where many simulated data sets of bin yields are generated for different values of the physics parameters. The slope of the generated versus fit values should be one and the intercept should be zero for an unbiased sample. If the slope differs significantly from unity, the associated systematic uncertainty is assessed using the uncertainty in the slope and the data central values. In this analysis, the slope for xDπξ differs by three standard deviations, but it has no impact on the φ3 extraction as it is a nuisance parameter in the fit.

The fraction of events is replaced with a sum of the nominal fraction and the uncertainty on the fraction for each event category and bin. The uncertainties of B → Xc ℓνell composition are determined using branching fraction uncertainties and a set of orthogonal parameter variations for each decay. Efficiencies for identifying or misidentifying leptons and hadrons are estimated from ancillary measurements, and uncertainties are propagated to wi(q2) using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The analysis is repeated with varied histograms, and the variation of the resulting moments is taken as the systematic uncertainties due to these sources. The impact of the choice of the smoothing factor for the interpolation of the cubic splines used to derive w(q2) is found to be negligible. The second group of uncertainties is related to assumptions when calibrating the moments. Modeling of B → Xc ℓνell and the Belle II detector affects the calibration function and calibration factors. Alternative sets of moments are derived based on varied signal probability functions or modified calibration. The deviation from the nominal result is used to estimate the systematic uncertainty.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-002", "page": 7, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties broken down in the analysis of Belle II data for B → D(∗)ηℓνell decays, and how do they vary with the q2 threshold?", "answer": "In the analysis of Belle II data for B → D(∗)ηℓνell decays, the systematic uncertainties are broken down into several categories, including Non-closure Bias, Background Subtraction, and various Calibration uncertainties (MC Statistics, Reconstruction, and Xc Model). The total systematic uncertainty decreases with increasing q2 threshold, while the statistical uncertainty increases. At low q2 thresholds and for the first and second moments, the q2 resolution from mismodeling of the number of charged particles in the X system, B → Xc ℓνell modeling, and background subtraction are of similar size. The branching fraction and BGL parameter uncertainties of the resonant decays B → D ℓνell and B → D∗ ℓνell are smaller than the uncertainty due to the composition of the higher mass states of the Xc spectrum. At high q2 thresholds, MC simulation statistics can also be sizeable sources of uncertainty for the first and second moments. For the third and fourth moments, the dominant uncertainty at high q2 thresholds is from the mismodeling of the number of charged particles in the X system.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-002", "page": 8, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How have precise measurements of D0 and D+ lifetimes been used to test effective models and provide inputs for various studies in the field of physics?", "answer": "Precise measurements of D0 and D+ lifetimes are essential for testing effective models, such as heavy-quark expansion, which underpin strong-interaction calculations required for determining fundamental standard-model parameters from hadron-decay measurements. These models are used to extract the strength of quark-mixing couplings from decay widths. Lifetime measurements also serve as valuable inputs for comparing measured decay branching fractions to predictions for partial decay widths in a wide variety of studies. Weakly decaying charmed hadrons have lifetimes ranging from approximately 0.1 to 1 ps, and precise knowledge of these lifetimes is crucial for understanding the behavior of these particles. The recent high-precision measurements of the D+s meson and charmed baryons relative to the D+ meson by the LHCb collaboration have minimized systematic uncertainties. The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy e+e−collider has the potential to make accurate absolute lifetime measurements with its vertex detector, but it must be complemented with precise vertex-detector alignment, calibration of final-state particle momenta, and powerful background discrimination.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-003", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are D*+ candidates selected in the Belle II experiment and what are the criteria used to identify them?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, D*+ candidates are selected using several criteria to ensure their validity. A D*+ candidate must have oppositely charged tracks with at least one hit in the first layer of the PXD, at least one hit in the SVD, and at least 20 hits in the CDC. These tracks must be identified as kaons if negative, or pions otherwise. Low-momentum pion candidates are required to have hits in both the SVD and CDC and are combined with D0 candidates to form D*+ → D0π+ decays. A global decay-chain vertex fit constrains the tracks according to the decay topology and constrains the D*+ candidate to originate from the measured position of the e+e− interaction region (IR). The IR has typical dimensions of 250 µm along the z-axis and 10 µm and 0.3 µm in the two directions of the transverse plane. The mass of the D0 candidate, m(K−π+), must be in the range [1.75, 2.00] GeV/c2, and the difference between the D*+ and D0-candidate masses, ∆m, must satisfy 144.94 < ∆m < 145.90 MeV/c2. To suppress background from bottom meson decays, the momentum of the D*+ in the e+e− center-of-mass system must exceed 2.5 GeV/c.

{"question": "How are the lifetimes of D0 and D+ determined in the Crystal Ball function, and how is the background modeled in the signal regions?", "answer": "The lifetimes of D0 and D+ are determined by fitting the (t, σt) distributions of the candidates in the signal regions using unbinned maximum-likelihood fits. The signal probability-density function (PDF) is a convolution of an exponential distribution in t with a resolution function that depends on σt, multiplied by the PDF of σt. In the D+ case, a Gaussian distribution is sufficient to model the resolution function, while in the D0 case, an additional Gaussian distribution is needed to describe the 3% of candidates with poorer resolution. The background in the D0 case is neglected in the fit and accounted for later as a systematic uncertainty, while in the D+ case, it is modeled using data with m(K−π+π+) in the sideband [1.758, 1.814] ∪[1.936, 1.992] GeV/c2, which is assumed to contain exclusively background candidates and be representative of the background in the signal region. The background PDF consists of a zero-lifetime component and two exponential components, all convolved with a Gaussian resolution function having a free mean and a width corresponding to sσt. A simultaneous fit to the candidates in the signal region and sideband is performed to better constrain the background parameters. The PDF of σt is a histogram template derived directly from the data, and the lifetime fits are tested on fully simulated data and on sets of data generated by randomly sampling the PDF with parameters ﬁxed to the values found in the ﬁts to the data. All tests yield unbiased results and expected parameter uncertainties, independent of the assumed values of the D0 and D+ lifetimes.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-003", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}

The systematic uncertainties arise from various sources listed in Table I and described in the content. The total systematic uncertainty is calculated as the sum in quadrature of the individual components. It is also mentioned that decay time and decay-time uncertainty are correlated in data, and when these correlations are neglected in the fits, the resulting model can lead to an imperfect description of the t distribution as a function of σt. The impact of neglecting these correlations is quantified by fitting the model to 1000 samples of signal-only simulated decays, each the same size as the data, obtained by resampling, with repetition, a set of simulated e+e− collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 500 fb−1.

For the D0 →K−π+ decay, a systematic uncertainty of 0.24 fs is assigned due to the neglected background contamination in the fit. The background contamination under the D+ →K−π+π+ peak is already accounted for in the fit using sideband data.

The uncertainty from the alignment procedure is evaluated using simulated signal-only decays reconstructed with a misaligned detector, resulting in uncertainties of 0.72 fs and 1.70 fs for D0 →K−π+ and D+ →K−π+π+ decays, respectively. The momentum calibration is cross-checked using abundant charmed-, strange-, and bottom-hadron decays, contributing systematic uncertainties of 0.19 fs for D0 and 0.48 fs for D+.

{"question": "How is the mismodeling of continuum simulation corrected for in the data-driven procedure presented in Ref. [13]?", "answer": "In the data-driven procedure presented in Ref. [13], the mismodeling of continuum simulation is corrected by training a binary classifier, BDTc, to separate off-resonance data and continuum simulation. BDTc is trained with events that satisfy BDT1 > 0.9 in the off-resonance data and an independent 100 fb−1 sample of simulated continuum events. The ratio of the classifier output for a given continuum event, p, to (1 −p) can be interpreted as an estimate of the likelihood ratio L(data)/L(MC), where L(data) (L(MC)) is the likelihood of the continuum event being from data (simulation). This event weight is then applied to the simulated continuum events after the final selection. Comparison of simulated continuum events with off-resonance data shows that the application of this weight improves the modeling of the input variables.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2021-004", "page": 12, "chunk_type": "text"}

These subsystems are embedded in a 1.5 T magnetic field generated by a superconducting solenoid. Monte Carlo simulations are performed using software packages such as EvtGen, PYTHIA, KKMC, PHOTOS, and GEANT4 to produce signal and background models, calculate reconstruction efficiencies, and detector acceptance. Simulated beam-induced backgrounds are added to the events and analyzed using the Belle II analysis software framework, basf2.

Resonant and nonresonant Cabibbo-suppressed semileptonic B decays are also simulated using a hybrid model. The signal B meson's partner is reconstructed using the Full Event Interpretation (FEI) algorithm, which separates final-state particles from the two B mesons and increases signal purity. Three variables are used to maximize the purity of the Btag selection: beam-constrained mass Mbc, energy difference ∆E, and a confidence score PFEI. Signal-lepton candidates are reconstructed with pBℓ > 1.3 GeV/c from the remaining tracks after Btag reconstruction, with lepton charge corresponding to the charge of a primary lepton from the semileptonic decay of a signal B meson. Lepton candidates are required to pass specific identification criteria, such as extrapolation to the point of closest approach to the measured interaction point and angular acceptance. Muon candidates have a transverse momentum pT > 0.4 GeV/c and are identified using a discriminator based on charged-particle hypotheses.

The residuals provided are a measure of the difference between the expected and observed values in the Belle II and Xe datasets. The residuals are given for different pB (momentum) ranges of particles 'e' in GeV/c. The first column represents the pB values, and the following columns show the residuals for Belle II data, Xe data, and the total uncertainty for each dataset.\n\nFor the Belle II dataset, the residuals are within the total uncertainty range, indicating a good agreement between the observed and expected values. Similarly, for the Xe dataset, the residuals are also within the total uncertainty range, suggesting a reasonable agreement.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the residuals for the Xe dataset are systematically higher than those for the Belle II dataset, particularly in the 1.4-2.0 GeV/c range. While both datasets are within their respective uncertainty ranges, the difference between the two could suggest that there may be some additional factor affecting the Xe dataset in this momentum range.\n\nIn summary, both the Belle II and Xe datasets show good agreement between observed and expected values, but there is a noticeable difference in the residuals for the Xe dataset in the 1.4-2.0 GeV/c range, which could warrant further investigation.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-002", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "What is the R(Xe/µ) value and its associated uncertainties in the full phase space, and how does it compare to the standard-model prediction?", "answer": "The R(Xe/µ) value in the full phase space is given by the equation R(Xe/µ) = 1.007 ± 0.009 (stat) ± 0.019 (syst), as reported in the study. The total uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty associated with lepton-identification efficiencies and misidentification probabilities, which is 1.9%. The study also notes that this measurement is consistent with a previous measurement from Belle in exclusive B →D∗ℓν decays.

{"question": "What is the meaning of MC tot unc in the given table and how is it used in physics?", "answer": "In the context of physics, MC tot unc likely refers to 'Monte Carlo Total Uncertainty'. Monte Carlo simulations are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results. These simulations are used in physics to model complex systems and predict their behavior. The 'total uncertainty' refers to the overall uncertainty in the results of the simulation, which can come from various sources such as statistical fluctuations, approximations, and measurement errors.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"What is the meaning of MC tot unc in the given table and how is it used in physics?\",\n\"answer\": \"In the context of physics, 'MC tot unc' typically refers to the total uncertainty in a measurement or calculation, where 'MC' could stand for Monte Carlo, a common technique used in physics to estimate uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulations involve generating many random samples to estimate the range of possible outcomes and the associated uncertainties. The 'tot' in 'MC tot unc' likely indicates that this is the total uncertainty, incorporating all sources of uncertainty in the measurement or calculation.\n\nThe table with 0 rows and 2 columns you provided might be a placeholder or an example of what the table would look like if it contained data. In a real table, the first column would list the quantities being measured or calculated, and the second column would give the corresponding total uncertainty.\n\nFor example, if the table contained data on the measurement of an object's position, it might look something like this:\n\n| Position (m) | MC tot unc (m) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2.5 | 0.02 |\n| 3.2 | 0.03 |\n\nIn this case, the 'MC tot unc' column gives the total uncertainty in the measurement of the position in meters. This uncertainty reflects the combined effects of all sources of error in the measurement, such as instrument precision, measurement technique, and environmental factors.\n\nIt's important to note that uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of any measurement or calculation in physics, as it reflects the inherent limitations of our knowledge and the tools we use to measure the world around us. By quantifying uncertainty, physicists can better understand the reliability and accuracy of their results and make more informed conclusions based on their data.\"\n}", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-002", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "table"}

{"question": "How are the B decays vertex positions determined and what are the reconstruction efficiencies for different B decay modes in the given physics experiment?", "answer": "In the given physics experiment, the B decay vertices are determined using different algorithms for B sig and B tag decays.

These include day-by-day variations of the detector alignment, misalignments remaining after applying the alignment procedure, and uncertainties in the IR position, √s, and boost vector. Systematic uncertainties are also estimated due to mismodeling the C distribution and possible correlations with ∆E, as well as from the choice of ∆E model for the q¯q and B ¯B backgrounds and the σ∆tℓ model. Additionally, the impact of fixing the yield of B 0 →D(∗)−K+ decays relative to B 0 →D(∗)−π+ is checked with alternative choices of the B 0 →D(∗)−K+ fraction.

{"question": "How does the Belle II Collaboration search for new particles decaying into tau pairs in e+e− collisions, and what are the results of their analysis?", "answer": "The Belle II Collaboration conducted a search for a X → τ+τ− resonance, where X = Z′, S, or ALP, in e+e−→ µ+µ−τ +τ −events. The analysis looked for a narrow enhancement in the distribution of the recoil mass against two oppositely charged muons, Mrecoil(µµ). This search resulted in no evidence for a signal, and the collaboration set exclusion limits at 90% confidence level on the product of cross section and branching fraction into τ pairs, ranging from 0.7 fb to 24 fb. They also set world-leading constraints on the couplings for the leptophilic scalar model for masses above 6.5 GeV/c2 and for the axion-like particle model over the entire mass range. The collaboration used a 62.8 fb−1 sample of e+e− collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV by the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider, targeting three different models predicting a spin-1 particle coupling only to the heavier lepton families, a Higgs-like spin-0 particle that couples preferentially to charged leptons (leptophilic scalar), and an axion-like particle.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "Can you explain the analysis selections and techniques used in the study of e+e− collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV, as recorded by the Belle II detector at SuperKEKB?", "answer": "In the analysis of e+e− collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV, recorded by the Belle II detector at SuperKEKB, the Lµ −Lτ model was used to devise the analysis selections. The primary focus was the process e+e−→Z′ (→ τ +τ −) µ+µ−, where the X resonance is predominantly emitted as final-state radiation (FSR) off one of the two muons. The analysis was restricted to τ-lepton decays to one charged particle and any number of neutral particles.\nThe analysis selected events with exactly four charged particles, with at least two identified as muons (tagging muons). The main expected backgrounds were e+e−→q¯q(γ), e+e−→τ +τ −(γ), and four-lepton processes. A multi-variate analysis was employed to enhance the signal-to-background ratio.\nA control sample was used to compare data to simulation, and systematic uncertainties were estimated. The signal yield was extracted through fits to the Mrecoil(µµ) distribution, allowing for a direct estimate of the background from data. The analysis techniques were defined using simulated events prior to examining data to minimize bias.\nThe Belle II detector consists of several sub-detectors arranged in a cylindrical structure around the e+e−interaction point. Charged-particle trajectories are reconstructed by a tracking system, while time-of-propagation and aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors provide charged-particle identification. The electromagnetic calorimeter reconstructs photons and identifies electrons, and a K0 L and muon detection subsystem is installed in the iron flux return of the solenoid for muon detection.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are signal events and background processes simulated, and what is the overall trigger efficiency for different Z' masses?", "answer": "In the given context, signal events are simulated using MadGraph5@NLO, including initial-state radiation (ISR). The Mrecoil(µµ) resolution varies with the Z′ mass, with a value of 30 MeV/c2 at the kinematic threshold 2mτ, decreasing smoothly to 10 MeV/c2 at 6 GeV/c2 and to 1 MeV/c2 at 10 GeV/c2. Events are generated for Z′ masses ranging from 3.6 to 10 GeV/c2 in steps of 25, 20, 10, and 5 MeV/c2. Background processes are simulated using various generators such as KKMC, Pythia8, EvtGen, and AAFH. Electromagnetic FSR is simulated with Photos for processes generated with EvtGen. However, four-lepton processes generated with AAFH do not include ISR effects. Additional non-simulated backgrounds include e+e−→µ+µ−π+π− processes and two-photon processes e+e−→e+e−h, where h is typically a low-mass hadronic system. The detector geometry and interactions of final-state particles with detector material are simulated using Geant4 and the Belle II software. The online event selection (trigger) is a logical OR of a three-track trigger and a single-muon trigger. The three-track-trigger efficiency is measured in four-track events containing at least two pions and one electron, while the single-muon-trigger efficiency is measured in events with one electron and one muon. The overall trigger efficiency is 96% for Z′ masses up to 8 GeV/c2, then it decreases smoothly to 90% at 9 GeV/c2 and to 50% at 10 GeV/c2.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How does the analysis procedure described in the text suppress background events in the search for a specific Z' signal in e+e- collisions?", "answer": " The analysis procedure to suppress background events in the search for a specific Z' signal in e+e- collisions involves several steps. First, they require that the transverse and longitudinal projections of the distance of closest approach of tracks to the interaction point be smaller than 0.5 and 2.0 cm, respectively. Events must have exactly four charged particles with zero net charge, with at least a pair of oppositely-charged particles identified as muons and the remaining two particles identified as electrons, muons, or charged hadrons. The four-track invariant mass M(4 tracks) must be below 9.5 GeV/c2 to suppress four-lepton backgrounds. The remaining background is dominated by e+e-→q¯q(γ) and e+e-→τ+τ-(γ) processes. To further discriminate signal from background, they identify 14 variables, including momenta of tagging muons, components of the recoil momentum transverse to the momentum direction of each tagging muon, and topological variables defined in the rest frame of the system recoiling against the two muons. Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are trained on simulated signal and background events to perform the final signal-from-background discrimination. The MLP selection reduces e+e-→q¯q(γ) and e+e-→τ+τ-(γ) processes by two to three orders of magnitude, resulting in significant contributions from four-lepton e+e-→µ+µ−τ+τ- and e+e-→e+e−τ+τ- processes. The full selection is applied to signal events simulated according to two additional models, and the signal efficiencies are compared with those estimated for the Lµ−Lτ model, showing relative differences in the range 10%–20%.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "What is the number of signal and background events per 5.2 MeV/c² for the given Mrecoil( ) [GeV/c²] bins in the Belle II data, and how does it compare to the data?", "answer": "The table provided shows the number of signal and background events per 5.2 MeV/c² for different Mrecoil( ) [GeV/c²] bins in the Belle II data. The first column represents the Mrecoil( ) [GeV/c²] values, and the following columns show the corresponding entries per 100 MeV/c² for Belle II data, signal+background, signal, and background events.\n\nFor a more specific example, let's consider the Mrecoil( ) [GeV/c²] bin of 6.0:\n- Belle II data: 10 events per 100 MeV/c² (equivalent to 1.92 events per 5.2 MeV/c²)\n- Signal+background: 5.9 events per 5.2 MeV/c² (this value is given directly in the table)\n- Signal: We don't have this value directly, but we can calculate it by subtracting the background from the signal+background. So, Signal = 5.9 - Background.\n- Background: 4.0 events per 5.2 MeV/c² (this value is given directly in the table)\n\nNote that the provided content does not include the background events per 5.2 MeV/c² for the Mrecoil( ) [GeV/c²] value of 6.0. You would need to perform the calculation as mentioned above to find the background events per 5.2 MeV/c².\n\nFor the data, the table provides the entries per 100 MeV/c² for Belle II data, which can be converted to events per 5.2 MeV/c² by dividing by 20 (since 100 MeV/c² / 5.2 MeV/c² = 19.23, approximately 20).", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are the signal yields obtained and cross sections determined in the study of the recoil mass against two tagging muons in e+e− collisions?", "answer": "The signal yields are obtained from a scan over the Mrecoil(µµ) spectrum through a series of unbinned maximum likelihood fits. The signal Mrecoil(µµ) distributions are parametrized from the simulation as sums of two Crystal Ball functions sharing the same mean value. The scan step-size is half the mass resolution, and each fit extends over an interval 40 times larger than the Z′ mass resolution. The background is described with a constant. After determining the signal and background yields using a fixed signal shape, signal yields are converted into cross sections, after correcting for signal efficiency and luminosity. Systematic uncertainties affecting the cross-section determination are taken into account, including uncertainties due to signal efficiency, luminosity, and fit procedure. These uncertainties are summed in quadrature, resulting in a final relative systematic uncertainty on the cross section varying in the range 8.8%--10.0% depending on the Z′ mass.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "What are the results of the search for a resonance decaying to τ+τ- in e+e−→µ+µ−τ +τ −events using Belle II data?", "answer": "The search resulted in no significant excess above the background, and upper limits on the cross section were set, ranging from 0.7 fb to 24 fb, for masses between 3.6 and 10 GeV/c2. Exclusion limits on the couplings were also derived for three different models: the Lµ−Lτ model, a leptophilic scalar model (with first-time probing of masses above 6.5 GeV/c2), and a model with an ALP decaying to leptons (for which world-leading limits were set over the entire mass range considered). The analysis also led to constraints on the coupling ξ of the leptophilic scalar S to be smaller than approximately 200 for masses above 6.5 GeV/c2 and on the coupling |Cℓℓ|/Λ for an ALP decaying to leptons to be as low as 200 TeV−1.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "What are the observed 90% CL upper limits and corresponding expected limits as functions of mass on the leptophilic scalar coupling ξ and on the ALP coupling to leptons |Cℓℓ|/Λ, along with other constraints shown in Figure 4?", "answer": "Figure 4 shows the observed 90% CL upper limits and corresponding expected limits as functions of mass on the leptophilic scalar coupling ξ (top) and on the ALP coupling to leptons |Cℓℓ|/Λ (bottom) in the hypothesis of equal couplings to the three lepton families and zero couplings to all other particles. The limits are based on the data collected by the BaBar and Belle II detectors, with a dataset of dt = 62.8 fb−1 for BaBar and an expected dataset of 500 fb−1 for Belle II. Additionally, the plot shows constraints for a scalar particle (S) decaying in electrons or muons from a BABAR search and constraints for an ALP decaying to leptons from a reinterpretation of BABAR searches.

The second case includes all the other topologies and the signal is more uniformly distributed. \n\nFor the rest-of-event (ROE), which is the system made of all charged and neutral particles except the two tagging muons, the following discriminant variables are constructed: \n- The difference between M(4 tracks) and the sum of the ROE invariant mass, computed assuming the pion mass hypothesis for tracks and zero mass for neutrals. \n- The difference between the total energy of the four-track system and the sum of the ROE energy and the total energy of the two tagging muons. \nThese discriminant variables are used to distinguish signal from background events in the analysis of τ decays.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-004", "page": 9, "chunk_type": "text"}

The branching fraction was measured to be B(B0 →π0π0) = (1.38 ± 0.27 ± 0.22) × 10−6 and the CP asymmetry was ACP(B0 →π0π0) = 0.14 ± 0.46 ± 0.07, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. These measurements are important for testing the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix and constraining possible flavor-structure extensions of the standard model. Improved measurements of the least known angle of the unitarity triangle, ϕ2, will be possible with more precise measurements of the time-dependent decay-rate asymmetry between B0 and B0 mesons that decay to π+π−final states. The B →ππ isospin relations can be used to disentangle the penguin and tree contributions, but precise measurements of the branching fraction and CP asymmetries of each B →ππ decay mode are required. The greatest limitation to exploiting the isospin relations lies in the uncertainty of the B0 →π0π0 inputs, and theoretical predictions for B(B0 →π0π0) are approximately five times smaller than the world average value. A better understanding of the color-suppressed tree amplitude could help resolve the so-called B →Kπ puzzle and various approaches have been proposed to address this disagreement.

Charged particles are reconstructed and their momentum measured using a silicon pixel detector, a four-layer double-sided silicon strip detector, and a central drift chamber. A time-of-propagation counter and an aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov detector are used for charged particle identification. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) identifies electrons and photons and covers about 90% of the solid angle in the center-of-mass frame. Resistive plate chambers and scintillating fibers are installed in the flux return of the magnet to identify muons and K0L mesons. A GEANT4-based simulation is used to optimize event selection criteria, compare distributions observed in data with expectations, determine fit models, calculate signal efficiencies, and study sources of background. To account for a large observed τ+τ− background, a sample of e+e−→τ+τ− events generated with KKMC and TAUOLA is used. The B0 →π0π0 decay is challenging to measure due to its CKM-suppressed and color-suppressed nature, the presence of neutral pions in e+e−→q¯q continuum events, and beam-induced background. To overcome these challenges, conventional and machine-learning based approaches are employed, and a maximum likelihood fit is performed to determine the signal yield and asymmetry coefficient. In the offline analysis, photon candidates are identified by requiring the number of crystals in an ECL energy deposition to be greater than 1.5, and the cluster timing to be within 200 ns of the offline estimated event time. A boosted decision tree (BDT) is used to suppress non-signal photons and account for the angular dependence of ECL-related variables, and a requirement is imposed on the Photon-BDT output to maximize the figure-of-merit S/√S + B.

The sideband data consists of events that satisfy all selection criteria but are in a signal-depleted region (5.22 < Mbc < 5.27 GeV/c2 and 0.1 < ∆E < 0.5 GeV). The BDT classifier uses 28 variables, including modified Fox-Wolfram moments, sphericity-related quantities, thrust-related quantities, and sets of concentric cones with various opening angles centered around the thrust axis. Variables that show correlations with ∆E and Mbc greater than 5% are excluded. The continuum classifier output is transformed into a Gaussian-like shape, and candidate B mesons are required to have |Tc| < 3. After suppression of continuum background, 1.3% of events have more than one B0 candidate, and the average multiplicity is 2.03 candidates per event. The correct B0 candidate is chosen by requiring the minimum sum of the absolute deviations of the reconstructed π0 masses from the known value. Following all selections, 35.5% of signal events remain, of which 99.0% are correctly reconstructed.

The signal component's PDF is modeled using equation (5) in the content, which takes into account the fraction of signal events incorrectly tagged, the difference in the wrong-tag fraction between positive and negative tags, and the asymmetry of the tagging efficiency. The fraction of signal events in each r interval, along with the wrong-tag fraction, the difference in the wrong-tag fraction between positive and negative tags, and the asymmetry of the tagging efficiency, are fixed to values obtained from a fit to B0 → D(∗)−h+ decays. The Tc PDFs of the signal, continuum, and BB components are each modeled using the sum of a Gaussian and a bifurcated Gaussian function with independent mean and width parameters. The Tc PDFs for the signal and BB are modeled independently for each r bin using simulated data, while the Tc PDF for continuum events is the same for all r bins and is taken from the data sideband. For the (Mbc, ∆E) modeling, a small correlation between Mbc and ∆E for the signal is taken into account by using a two-dimensional kernel-density shape. The Mbc and ∆E modeling of the B+B− and B0B0 backgrounds is simplified by assuming that they follow the same distributions as the dominant B+ → ρ+π0 and B0 → K0S(→ π0π0)π0 decays, respectively.

{"question": "How are Ω0c candidates selected and fitted in the analysis, and how is the signal purity determined?", "answer": "Ω0c candidates are selected by requiring the angle between their momentum and displacement from the IP to be smaller than 90°. They are formed by combining Ω− candidates with positively charged particles originating from the e+e− interaction and having momenta greater than 0.5 GeV/c. The scaled momentum of the Ω0c candidate must be larger than 0.6. A decay-chain vertex fit constrains the tracks according to the decay topology and constrains the Ω0c candidate to originate from the e+e− interaction region. Only candidates with fit probabilities larger than 0.001 and σt values smaller than 1.0 ps are retained for further analysis. The mass of the Ω0c candidate must be in the range [2.55, 2.85] GeV/c2. After these requirements, about 0.5% of events have multiple Ω0c candidates; for these events, the candidate with the highest vertex-fit probability is retained.\n\nAn unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the m(Ω−π+) distribution is used to determine the signal purity in the signal region defined by 2.68 < m(Ω−π+) < 2.71 GeV/c2. In the fit, the Ω0c signal is modeled with a Gaussian distribution, and the background is modeled with a straight line. The signal region contains approximately 132 candidates with a signal purity of (66.5 ± 3.3)%.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-007", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}

On the other hand, the background template is obtained directly from the sideband data. This approach does not use any direct input from simulation in the fit. The signal and background PDFs of σt, which differ between signal and background, are histogram templates derived directly from the data.\"\n}\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the decay-time distributions for Ω0c → Ω−π+ candidates populating the signal region and sideband are shown in Figure 2, with fit projections overlaid. Similarly, the distributions of decay time and decay-time uncertainty are shown in Figures 2 and 3, also with fit projections overlaid.

One thousand pseudoexperiments, each the same size as the data, were generated for each tested lifetime value. The bias was found to be mostly due to the small sample size and reduces when simulating larger sizes. Its absolute value is assigned as a symmetric systematic uncertainty.

{"question": "How was the systematic uncertainty in the Ω0c lifetime measurement determined in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "The systematic uncertainty in the Ω0c lifetime measurement was determined by several methods in the Belle II experiment. A signal-only simulation was performed with five samples, each the same size as the data, obtained by resampling with replacement from a sample of simulated e+e− collisions. The average difference between the measured and true lifetimes was found to be 2.8 fs, which was corrected for a known fit bias of -3.4 fs, resulting in a systematic uncertainty of 6.2 fs due to the imperfect resolution model. The decay-time resolution function's mean was also found to depend nearly linearly on the candidate mass, and its associated uncertainty was checked to be negligible by varying the boundaries of the signal region. Additionally, a pseudoexperiment study was conducted to quantify the bias in the modeling of the background (t, σt) distribution, which resulted in a systematic uncertainty of 8.3 fs. The effect of possible residual misalignment on the measured lifetime was also quantified by simulating large samples of signal decays with various misalignment configurations, resulting in a systematic uncertainty of 1.6 fs. Finally, uncertainties in the knowledge of the absolute momentum scale and in the world-average value of the Ω0c mass each resulted in a 0.2 fs uncertainty in the lifetime. The resulting measurement, τ(Ω0c) = 243 ± 48 (stat) ± 11 (syst) fs, is consistent with the LHCb average and inconsistent with the pre-LHCb world average.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-007", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How does the Belle II Collaboration search for a Z' in the process e+e−→µ+µ−Z' with Z' →invisible, and what are the two scenarios considered in the search?", "answer": "The Belle II Collaboration searches for a Z' in the process e+e−→µ+µ−Z' with Z' →invisible by looking for a narrow enhancement in the distribution of the mass recoiling against a muon pair. They consider two scenarios: the 'vanilla' Lµ−Lτ model, where the Z' couples only to SM particles and decays into neutrinos with a branching fraction B(Z′ →ν¯ν) that varies between ~33% and ~100% depending on the Z' mass, and the 'fully invisible' Lµ−Lτ model, where the Z' can decay directly into a pair of dark-matter particles χ¯χ with a coupling constant αD = g′D2/4π, and B(Z′ →χ¯χ) ≈1. The search is performed for Z' masses less than 9 GeV/c2 in both scenarios. In the 'vanilla' model, the intrinsic width ΓZ′ of the Z' is negligible compared with the experimental resolution, while in the 'fully invisible' model, ΓZ′ depends on αD and is negligible for small values of αD.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How does the analysis described in the text use kinematic variables, an artificial neural network, and a photon veto to reduce backgrounds in searching for a Z' signal?\",\n\"answer\": \" The analysis uses several kinematic variables to distinguish the Z' signal from backgrounds. In the center-of-mass frame, it considers the transverse momentum of a muon with respect to the dimuon thrust axis, the transverse momentum of the higher-energy muon with respect to the momentum direction of the lower-energy muon, the longitudinal momentum of the higher-energy muon with respect to the momentum direction of the lower-energy muon, and the transverse momentum of the dimuon system. These variables help in identifying the kinetic properties of Z' production through radiation from a final state muon, as opposed to τ +τ −(γ) events where the recoil momentum arises from neutrinos from τ decays. Additionally, a photon veto is imposed, requiring the total energy of all photons to be less than 0.5 GeV and no photon to be within 15° of the recoil momentum. A transverse recoil momentum of at least 0.5 GeV/c in the center-of-mass frame is required to suppress µ+µ−(γ) and e+e−µ+µ−backgrounds. An artificial neural network, Punzi-net, is trained on simulated signal and background events to optimize a figure of merit for all Z' mass hypotheses simultaneously. It produces an output between 0 (background) and 1 (signal), and events with an output larger than 0.5 are selected. After these selections, the background comes dominantly from τ +τ −(γ) events and e+e−µ+µ−events. The Punzi-net selection removes nearly all τ +τ −(γ) background for M2recoil < 50 GeV2/c4, with a sensitivity gain between 5 and 15, depending on the mass. The residual background comes dominantly from µ+µ−(γ) in the region M2recoil < 50 GeV2/c4 and from a large irreducible contribution of e+e−µ+µ−for M2reco", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-008", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How were the systematic uncertainties in the signal efficiency and template shapes determined in this physics analysis?", "answer": " In this analysis, systematic uncertainties in the signal efficiency were estimated by studying data-simulation mismodeling using the µµγ and eµ control samples in three M2recoil ranges: [−0.5, 9], [9, 36], and [36, 81] GeV2/c4. These control samples provided complementary coverage of the M2recoil range, with µµγ addressing the lower region and eµ covering the higher. Systematic uncertainties due to data-simulation mismodeling in the trigger, luminosity, tracking efficiency, muon identification, background cross sections, and selection effects were evaluated through data-simulation comparison before the application of the Punzi-net. Differences in Punzi-net selection-efficiency between data and simulation were also evaluated by studying their efficiencies. The resulting differences in data-to-simulation ratios of event yields before Punzi-net application and of Punzi-net efficiencies in the three M2recoil ranges were summed in quadrature, resulting in systematic uncertainties of 2.7%, 6.5%, and 8.3%, respectively. For the signal template shape, a systematic uncertainty of 10% was assigned due to the width of the M2recoil distribution being 8% larger in data than in simulation. Systematic uncertainties due to background shapes were evaluated using the µµγ and eµ samples and were assigned as twice the largest standard deviation of the bin-by-bin data-to-simulation ratios of the number of events in each of the three M2recoil ranges. Uncertainties from the photon-veto inefficiency were studied using the ee control sample and were on average 34% for M2recoil < 1 GeV2/c4, decreasing to 5% above 1 GeV2/c4. A systematic uncertainty of 1% was assigned to the measured integrated luminosity.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-008", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How was the search for the lepton-flavor-violating τ −→ ℓ−α decay with an invisible spin-0 α boson conducted using the Belle II detector?", "answer": "The search for the lepton-flavor-violating τ −→ ℓ−α decay was conducted using data from e+e− collisions produced by the SuperKEKB collider at KEK. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 62.8 fb−1, were recorded by the Belle II detector at a center-of-mass energy of √s = 10.58 GeV and contain 57.7 million e+e−→τ +τ − events. The Belle II detector consists of several subdetectors arranged in a cylindrical structure around the e+e− interaction point, including a tracking system, time-of-propagation and aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a dedicated subdetector for identifying K0L mesons and muons. In the center-of-mass frame, τ pairs are produced back-to-back, and the decay products of each τ are isolated from the others and contained in opposite hemispheres. The tag hemisphere is defined as that containing three charged particles, and the signal hemisphere contains only one charged particle. The τ −→ ℓ−α decay has an identical visible topology to that of τ −→ ℓ− ¯νℓντ, but the magnitude of the lepton momentum depends only on the α mass, providing a distinctive signature for the signal above the spectrum of τ −→ ℓ− ¯νℓντ. The τ momentum cannot be determined directly, but its energy in the center-of-mass frame can be approximated as √s/2, and its direction is approximated as being opposite to the three hadrons on the tag side. From these, the τ pseudo rest frame is constructed.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-009", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How is the search for τ −→ℓ−α conducted and what are the efficiencies of the trigger and selection process in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "The search for τ −→ℓ−α in the Belle II experiment involves looking for an excess of events above the normalized lepton energy spectrum of τ −→ℓ−¯νℓντ. The branching fraction ratio Bℓα/Bℓ¯νν is then measured using τ −→ℓ−¯νℓντ as a normalization channel. The trigger requires events with at least three localized energy deposits in the ECL, with one cluster having an energy above 0.3 GeV and the rest above 0.1 GeV, and a topology inconsistent with Bhabha scattering. The trigger efficiencies are 97% and 86% for the electron and muon channels, respectively. The selection process requires events to contain exactly four charged particles with zero total charge, each displaced from the average interaction space point by less than 3 cm in the z-axis direction and less than 1 cm in the transverse plane. The particle in the signal hemisphere must be identified as an electron or a muon, while charged particles in the tag hemisphere must satisfy the condition EECL/p ≤0.8. The backgrounds are suppressed using simulated events and the Belle II analysis software framework. The selection is optimized for the normalization channel using the figure of merit S/√S + B. The backgrounds from e+e−→q¯q are suppressed by rejecting events containing neutral pions and photons. The trigger and selection process have high efficiencies, but accurately modeling displaced clusters and low-momentum charged particles is challenging.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2022-009", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "What is the significance of the recent precise measurement of the Λ+c lifetime by the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy e+e− collider?", "answer": "The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy e+e− collider reported a precise measurement of the Λ+c lifetime using Λ+c → pK−π+ decays. This result, with a value of τ(Λ+c) = 203.20 ± 0.89 (stat) ± 0.77 (syst) fs, is the most precise measurement to date and is consistent with previous determinations. This measurement is important for refined tests of effective models, as careful consideration of model-dependent spectator effects is required for theoretical predictions of charm baryon lifetimes to agree with experimental measurements. Improved measurements of charm baryon lifetimes, like the one provided by Belle II, help resolve the tension between Λ+c lifetime measurements at e+e− colliders and other experiments and substantially improve the world average.

The resolution function width is given by the per-candidate σt multiplied by a scale factor, s, which is a free parameter in the lifetime fit. A simultaneous fit to events in the signal region and sidebands is performed to better constrain the background. The background fraction in the lifetime fit is Gaussian constrained to (7.50 ± 0.02)%, as determined from the M(pK−π+) fit. The systematic uncertainty is calculated from the sum in quadrature of individual contributions from various sources.

The measurement is based on the distribution of the transverse vertex displacement of Λ+c decays. The maximum contamination from Ξc backgrounds is estimated and corrected for, resulting in a systematic uncertainty of 0.34 fs. The resolution model for the lifetime probability density function (PDF) is complicated by correlations between the decay time and the decay-time uncertainty, which are neglected in the model and included as a systematic uncertainty of 0.46 fs. The resolution model is checked by replacing the Gaussian resolution function with a sum of two Gaussian functions, resulting in a difference in the measured lifetime of 0.36 ± 0.23 fs, which is covered by the corresponding systematic uncertainty. Detector misalignment and imperfections in the alignment of the tracking system can bias measured particle decay lengths and are accounted for by producing sets of signal-only simulated data with detectors randomly misaligned according to the alignment precision observed in data. The root mean square dispersion of the lifetime residuals in these misaligned simulated data sets is 0.46 fs, which is taken as a systematic uncertainty due to imperfect detector alignment. The momenta of charged particles are scaled by a factor determined by calibrating the peak positions of abundant charm, strange, and bottom hadron decays, resulting in a systematic uncertainty of 0.09 fs. The signal PDF for the M(pK-π+) fit is checked by replacing the sum of Gaussian and Johnson functions with a sum of two Gaussian functions, resulting in a negligible effect on the measured lifetime. The full analysis is repeated on subsets of data chosen according to data-collection periods and Λ+c momentum ranges, directions, and charge, and the result for each subset is consistent with the full result. The lifetime fit is also repeated by selecting the candidate with the best vertex fit probability or randomly selecting a candidate, resulting in a negligible difference in lifetime.

The horizon size is the distance that light can travel since the Big Bang, and it sets the scale for causally connected regions of the universe. Perturbations that are outside the horizon cannot be affected by local physical processes, and therefore, their evolution is determined by long-range forces and interactions.

This process contributes to the relic density of dark matter, allowing it to match the observed value. The mass of the A′ can arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, which introduces a new scalar particle: a dark Higgs boson h′. The annihilation process is mediated by the dark photon, which has a kinetic mixing (ε) with the hypercharge field of the standard model.\"\n}\n\nIn this model, the dark matter particles can interact with the standard model particles through the exchange of dark photons, which allows for the annihilation of dark matter particles to standard model particles and vice versa. This process is crucial in reproducing the observed relic density of dark matter. The mass of the dark photon is generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking, which also introduces a new scalar particle, the dark Higgs boson. The dark photon has a kinetic mixing with the hypercharge field of the standard model, which allows for the interaction between the dark sector and the standard model.\n\nIt's also important to note that the paper is searching for the so-called dark Higgsstrahlung process e+e−→A′h′ using data collected by the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider, and the analysis is focused on the scenario where the h′ is long-lived and invisible because it does not interact with the detector material.

{"question": "Can you describe the Belle II detector and the data used in the analysis of Υ(4S) resonance?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is a cylindrical structure consisting of several subdetectors arranged around the beam pipe. The inner-most subdetector is the vertex detector, which includes two layers of silicon pixels and four layers of silicon strips. The main tracking subdetector is a large helium-based small cell drift chamber (CDC). An electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) and a superconducting solenoid are also part of the detector. The longitudinal direction, transverse plane, and polar angle θ are defined with respect to the detector’s solenoidal axis. Data used in the analysis were collected in 2019 at a c.m. energy √s corresponding to the mass of the Υ(4S) resonance, for an integrated luminosity of 8.34 ± 0.08 fb−1. Simulated signal events were generated using MadGraph5 with and without initial-state radiation for A′ masses ranging from 0.21 to 10.45 GeV/c2 and h′ masses ranging from 0.01 GeV/c2 to the minimum of (MA′, √s/c2 −MA′) in variable steps. The resolution on MA′ ranges between 3 and 50 MeV/c2, and the resolution on Mh′ ranges between 30 and 900 MeV/c2.

The study uses data from various processes, such as $e^+e^-\to μ^+μ^-$, $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-$, $e^+e^-\to π^+π^-$, $π^+π^-(γ)$, $e^+e^-(γ)$, $b¯b$, $q¯q (q = u, d, s, c)$ interfaced with PYTHIA8 and EvtGen, $J/ψγ$, $ψ(2S)γ$, and $µ+µ−ν¯ν$, among which only $µ+µ−(γ)$, $τ +τ −(γ),$ and $e^+e^-\to μ^+µ−$ contribute significantly to the background.

{"question": "How are the search windows defined and what is their role in the analysis of simulated data in the M2recoil–M2µµ plane?", "answer": "In the analysis of simulated data in the M2recoil–M2µµ plane, the search windows are defined as ellipses in the M2recoil–M2µµ plane that take local correlation into account. Each window is centered at one of the values of (M2A′, M2h′) used to produce a simulated dataset. A sum of two two-dimensional Gaussian distributions that share a common mean and correlation is fitted to the simulated data without ISR. The elliptical search window boundaries correspond to the two-dimensional two-standard-deviation contours resulting from the fit. Search windows partially overlap to maximize signal efficiency, with an overlap in area typically around 75%. The average fraction of signal events retained in a search window is 71%, with variations due to the different effects induced by ISR depending on MA′ and Mh′. Accounting for correlation in defining the window increases the signal-to-background ratio by a factor of three to five. The signal efficiency of this method depends on the masses of the A′ and h′ and ranges between 10 and 25% for MA′ > 4 GeV/c2. The efficiency drops considerably for MA′ < 4 GeV/c2 and becomes too low to allow analysis for MA′ < 1.65 GeV/c2. Backgrounds are typically reduced by factors of 10–1000. The surviving background events come 78.5% from µ+µ−(γ), 18.5% from τ +τ −(γ), and 3% from e+e−µ+µ−.

{"question": "How was the e+e−→π+π−π0 cross section measured in the energy range 0.62 to 3.50 GeV by the Belle II collaboration?", "answer": "The Belle II collaboration measured the e+e−→π+π−π0 cross section in the energy range 0.62 to 3.50 GeV using initial state radiation (ISR) events. In this process, an electron-positron pair annihilates into a virtual photon, which then produces a pair of hadrons, such as π+ and π−, along with a photon. By detecting and reconstructing the π+π−π0 final state and measuring the energy of the ISR photon, the center-of-mass energy of the e+e− system can be determined. The collaboration then determined the cross section by counting the number of observed events and correcting for efficiency, acceptance, and radiative corrections. The measurement was based on a data sample collected at the SuperKEKB e+e− collider with an integrated luminosity of 189 fb−1.

{"question": "How does the measured hadronic cross section for e+e− annihilation at center-of-mass energies below 2 GeV impact the standard model prediction for the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment aµ?", "answer": "The measured hadronic cross section for e+e− annihilation at center-of-mass energies below 2 GeV is crucial for obtaining the standard model (SM) prediction for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment aµ through dispersion relations. A discrepancy of about five standard deviations between the world average of aµ measured by experiments and SM predictions based on dispersion relations has been reported. The HVP contribution is the main source of uncertainty in the SM prediction, accounting for more than 80% of the current theoretical uncertainty. Improving the precision of the HVP term is essential to clarifying the picture. Discrepancies between measurements of the cross section have an impact on the uncertainty in the HVP contribution to aµ. In the π+π− final state, the long-standing difference in experimental values between BABAR and KLOE contributes to the systematic uncertainty in aHVPμ. A result recently reported from CMD-3 suggests a different value closer to the SM, and recent predictions based on lattice QCD calculations show 2–3σ differences from values based on dispersion relations, indicating a smaller difference from the measured aµ.

{"question": "How is the cross section for e+e−→π+π−π0 measured in ISR production at the Belle II experiment, and how is it related to the double differential cross section of the ISR process?", "answer": "At the Belle II experiment, the cross section for e+e−→π+π−π0 in ISR production is measured by detecting events in which a single energetic ISR photon is emitted, while the e+e− system has a fixed center-of-mass (c.m.) energy. The relation between the double differential cross section of the ISR process and the cross section σ3π(√s′) is given by equation (1) in the content: dσ3πγ/d√s′d cos θ∗γ = 2√s′sW(s, s′, θ∗γ)σ3π(√s′). Here, θ∗γ is the polar angle of the ISR photon momentum relative to the beam axis in the c.m. frame, and W(s, s′, θ∗γ) is the radiator function describing the probability of the ISR photon emission, which is calculated by QED. The radiator function, given by equation (2) in the content, is predominantly non-zero for ISR photons emitted almost collinearly to the beam direction. The measured (visible) three-pion mass spectrum is related to the cross section through equation (3), which includes the signal efficiency (ε), the effective luminosity (dLeff/d√s′), and the radiative correction (rrad) to account for higher-order ISR processes.

To minimize experimental bias, the event selection and analysis workflow are optimized using simulated events before examining data. Several data control samples are used to determine the dominant backgrounds as well as signal efficiency correction factors.

{"question": "How are signal e+e−→π+π−π0γ candidates selected and backgrounds suppressed in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, signal e+e−→π+π−π0γ candidates are selected by requiring events to include an energetic ISR photon that satisfies a hardware-based ECL trigger with energy deposits exceeding 2 GeV of c.m. energy in the barrel region of the ECL. In the offline analysis, signal candidates are reconstructed from two oppositely charged particles and three photons, with charged particles and photons satisfying specific transverse momentum, wire hit, and interaction point requirements. The ISR photon candidate is required to have an energy greater than 2 GeV in the c.m. frame and a polar angle in the barrel region. To suppress extra ISR emission, the invariant mass of the π+π−γγγ system is required to be greater than 8.0 GeV/c2. A 4C kinematic fit is performed for all π+π−γγγ combinations if one photon satisfies the ISR criterion and the invariant mass of the remaining two photons is less than 0.3 GeV/c2. The distribution of χ22π3γ is used to determine the level of combinatorial γγ background. To reduce systematic uncertainty due to background subtraction, further selections are imposed, such as rejecting charged particles identified as electrons or kaons, requiring the square of the mass recoiling against the π+π−pair to be greater than 4 GeV2/c4, and applying π0 candidate selection criteria.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-002", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How are signal events extracted from the data in the Belle II experiment for the analysis of $π^0$ signals?\",\n\"answer\": \"In the Belle II experiment, signal events are extracted from the data by requiring that the $π^0$ candidates have two-photon invariant mass in the range $0.123 < M(γγ) < 0.147$ GeV/$c^2$.

However, the $π^0$ signals selected in this way include both true $π^0$ signals and combinatorial background in which the invariant mass of random combinations of two photons has a value near the mass of the $π^0$ meson. To extract a three pion mass $M(3π)$ distribution from the true $π^0$ signal without the combinatorial background, a fit is carried out to the $M(γγ)$ distribution in each three pion mass $M(3π)$ range. The signal PDF is modeled with the sum of a Novosibirsk function and a Gaussian function, while the combinatorial background is modeled with 1st- or 2nd-order polynomials. The fit is carried out in the $M(γγ)$ range $0.05–0.23$ GeV/$c^2$ for the $3π$ mass range $0.5–1.05$ GeV/$c^2$, $0.05–0.29$ GeV/$c^2$ for the $3π$ mass range $1.05–2$ GeV/$c^2$, and $0.07–0.29$ GeV/$c^2$ for the $3π$ mass range $2.0–3.5$ GeV/$c^2$. In each $3π$ mass region, a wide sideband region is selected so that the background event model correctly determines the non-$π^0$ background component.

{"question": "How are the results of the data and Monte Carlo simulation compared in the study, and what discrepancies were observed?", "answer": "In the study, the data and Monte Carlo simulation were compared as a consistency check after all selection requirements were applied. The energy and polar angle distributions of initial state radiation (ISR) photons in data were compared with simulation in Figure 5, and the momentum and polar angle distributions of charged pions were compared in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows the invariant mass distribution of the two pion system when the invariant mass of the π+π−π0 system is in the ω region, 0.72 < M(3π) < 0.84 GeV/c2. In these figures, the background simulation is scaled up by a factor of 50.

In Figure 8, the background simulation is scaled up by a factor of 10. The study also notes that BABAR in Ref. [44] observed a similar ρ-ω interference pattern near mω, which is not modeled by PHOKHARA.

The main backgrounds remaining in the sample are e+e−→π+π−π0π0γ, e+e−→K+K−π0γ, e+e−→qq, and combinatorial γγ background. The combinatorial γγ background is further investigated using data control samples, which are enhanced in specific background sources. For instance, a control sample that enhances the e+e−→π+π−π0π0γ background is selected by requiring χ22π5γ < 100 and 100 < χ22π3γ < 1000. The resulting π+π−π0π0γ sample has 95% purity.

The scale factor as a function of 3π mass is obtained by taking the ratio of the M(3π) distribution of the data to the corresponding simulated sample, which assumes a K∗(892)±K∓intermediate state. The K+K−π0γ model implemented in PHOKHARA and EvtGen reproduces the enhancement of the K+K−π0γ process with an accuracy of around 50%. A 10%–20% uncertainty due to the limited size of experimental and simulated samples and an uncertainty in the corrections to the pion-kaon identification efficiency is assigned for the scale factor.

{"question": "Can you explain the χ² distribution and its significance in the context of Belle II data and simulation samples?", "answer": "The χ² distribution, often denoted as f(χ²), is a probability distribution that describes the probability of obtaining a certain value of χ² in a statistical test. In the context of Belle II data and simulation samples, the χ² distribution is used to study the agreement between data and simulation for e+e−→µ+µ−γ events in the dimuon mass range below 1.05 GeV/c². The distribution is shown in the upper figure in Fig. 17, with the points representing the data and the filled histogram representing the simulation. The lower figure in Fig. 17 shows the data-to-simulation ratio of the efficiency ϵ(χ²thr) as a function of χ²thr. The results show that for any value of χ²thr above χ²thr > 20, the data-to-simulation ratio of the efficiency for µ+µ−γ is close to 1.00 within 0.2%. To address the uncertainty from the difference in the kinematic properties of charged particles between the µ+µ− and 3π samples, the data-to-simulation ratios are tested in subsamples divided by muon momentum. A systematic uncertainty of 0.6% is assigned based on the minimum and maximum ratios. A correction for the difference in the 4C fit χ² originating from the two photons of π0 decay is also included in the π0 efficiency correction. From these results, the correction factor for the selection on the 4C kinematic fit is determined to be ηχ² = (0.0 ± 0.6)% for M(3π) < 1.05 GeV/c².

{"question": "How does the presence of additional energetic ISR photons in the PHOKHARA generator affect the analysis of e+e−→π+π−π0γ events in Belle II data, and what is the assigned systematic uncertainty for the generator?", "answer": "The presence of an additional ISR photon along the beamline in e+e−→π+π−π0γ events in Belle II data, which is more frequent in PHOKHARA simulations compared to data, can affect the analysis. This is because events with such an additional photon usually fail the χ2 2π3γ selection criterion. Removing this excess in the simulation would increase the measured signal efficiency by (2.4 ± 0.7)%. The BABAR study also indicates that events with two additional energetic photons, a process not simulated by PHOKHARA, make up (3.5 ± 0.4)% of the events in the relevant mass range. If included in the simulation, such events would be expected to reduce the signal efficiency by an amount comparable to a 1.9% change in efficiency.

{"question": "Can you explain the process of signal extraction and unfolding in the given physics study?", "answer": "Sure, in this physics study, the signal extraction is performed in two regions of the invariant mass of the system: below 0.7 GeV/c² and 25-50 MeV/c² in the region above 1.05 GeV/c². The M(γγ) distribution in each M(3π) bin is fitted to extract the π⁰ yield. Before fitting for each bin, the line-shape parameters of the signal PDF, Novosibirsk function parameters, and Gaussian parameters are determined by fitting events in the M(3π) range below and above 1.05 GeV/c². A binned maximum-likelihood fit is then carried out with the signal PDF and a linear function to describe the combinatorial background. The signal normalization and background parameters are allowed to float in the fit. The M(γγ) distributions for events with M(3π) in the ω resonance region and around 900 MeV/c² are shown in Figure 18 as typical examples of signal-extraction fits in cases of large or small M(3π) bin populations. The signal yields resulting from the M(γγ) fits are shown as functions of M(3π) in Figures 19 (a) and (b). These histograms show the expected background from other processes, where the yields are obtained by fitting the M(γγ) distribution for each background process and applying correction factors discussed in Sec. IV. Prominent ω, ϕ, and J/ψ signal peaks, as well as broad enhancements due to the ω(1420) and ω(1650) resonances, are found in the 1.1-1.8 GeV/c² region.

{"question": "How is the mass spectrum of the 3π system unfolded using the Iterative Dynamic Stable Unfolding (IDS) method in the given physics experiment?", "answer": "In this physics experiment, the mass spectrum of the 3π system is unfolded using the Iterative Dynamic Stable Unfolding (IDS) method to transform the measured spectrum into a generated spectrum based on a transfer matrix Aij. This matrix describes the number of events generated in the jth M(3π) bin and reconstructed in the ith M(3π) bin. The IDS method is applied to simulated samples to obtain the transfer matrix, as shown in Figure 20. This method allows for the unfolding of structures that are not modeled in the simulation and avoids fluctuations from background subtraction. Before performing the unfolding procedure, potential data-simulation differences in the transfer matrix are evaluated due to incomplete simulation of mass resolution and momentum or energy scale.

BABAR counts π0 events in a mass window, while Belle II fits the M(γγ) distribution. The background size in the ω region is less than 1% in both experiments, but these differences affect the remaining background. The systematic uncertainty for the cross section is 1.3% for BABAR, dominated by detector effects (1.2%), and 2.2% for Belle II, dominated by the uncertainty in π0 efficiency (1.0%) and tracking efficiency (0.8%), along with a 1.2% uncertainty in ISR photon simulation.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-002", "page": 19, "chunk_type": "text"}

This content appears to be an outline for a presentation or document about the Belle II detector and related topics in physics. Here's a breakdown of the topics that it covers:\n\n1. **Introduction**: This section likely provides an overview of the Belle II detector and the physics goals of the experiment. The Belle II detector is a particle physics detector located at the SuperKEKB accelerator in Japan. It is designed to study the properties of B mesons and other particles in order to understand the fundamental nature of matter and the origins of the universe.\n\n2. **The Belle II detector, simulation and data samples**: This section probably describes the Belle II detector in more detail, as well as the simulation and data samples used in the analysis. The Belle II detector is a complex instrument that consists of several subdetectors designed to measure the properties of particles produced in high-energy collisions. Simulation is an important tool in particle physics, as it allows researchers to model the behavior of particles and predict the outcomes of experiments. Data samples refer to the actual data collected by the detector, which is analyzed to extract physical measurements.\n\n3. **Event reconstruction and background rejection**: This section probably covers the techniques used to reconstruct the particles produced in the collisions and reject background events that can mimic the signals of interest. Event reconstruction involves using the measurements from the subdetectors to infer the properties of the particles that produced them, such as their energy, momentum, and identity. Background rejection is important because there are often many more background events than signal events in a given data sample. By rejecting background events, researchers can improve the signal-to-background ratio and increase the sensitivity of their analysis.\n\nI hope this helps!

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"What is the charged-lepton flavor violation and what are the most stringent upper limits on the τ −→µ−µ+µ− branching fraction?\",\n\"answer\": \"Charged-lepton flavor violation (LFV) refers to the violation of the conservation of charged-lepton flavor in particle interactions, which is a symmetry in the Standard Model (SM) with massless neutrino hypotheses. However, this symmetry is broken at loop-level when taking into account neutrino mixing, leading to the existence of processes such as µ →e, τ →e and τ →µ conversions. The simplest SM extension that allows for massive neutrinos predicts LFV rates that are proportional to the square of neutrino masses, resulting in decay rates of 10−50, which are well below the sensitivities of any experiment. The observation of LFV decays would, therefore, provide indisputable evidence of physics beyond the SM. Over the past four decades, the CLEO experiment at CESR, and the first generation B-factory experiments BaBar at SLAC and Belle at KEK, have searched for LFV in τ-lepton decays. The most stringent upper limit for the decay τ −→µ−µ+µ− was set by the Belle collaboration at the level of 2.1 × 10−8 at the 90% confidence level (C.L.) using electron-positron data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 782 fb−1. The upper limits on the τ −→µ−µ+µ− branching fraction set by the CLEO and BaBar collaborations are 1.9×10−6 and 3.3×10−8, using 4.79 fb−1 and 468 fb−1 of data respectively.\"\n}\n​", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-003", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "What is the search for the LFV τ −→µ−µ+µ−decay using the Belle II detector and the data samples recorded with the e+e−SuperKEKB collider?", "answer": "The Belle II detector, located at the e+e−interaction point, consists of several subdetectors including a two-layer silicon-pixel detector, a four-layer double-sided silicon-strip detector, a central drift chamber, a time-of-propagation detector, an aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a K0L and muon detection system. This search for the LFV τ −→µ−µ+µ−decay uses a sample of 389 million e+e−→τ +τ −events recorded with the Belle II detector at the asymmetric-energy e+e−SuperKEKB collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 424 fb−1.

The search strategy and candidate reconstruction are presented in Section 3, systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section 4, and the branching fraction measurement and limit computation are presented in Section 5. The search uses only the signal tau decay mode, and the previous searches reconstructed both tau decay modes.

The trajectories of those particles are required to be displaced from the average interaction point by less than 3 cm along the z-axis and less than 1 cm in the transverse plane. The identification of muons of momentum greater than 0.7 GeV/c relies mostly on their penetration depth in the KLM, whereas for lower momenta information from the CDC and ECL dominate.

Can you also explain the concept of inclusive tagging, background rejection strategy, and signal efficiency optimization in the context of tau lepton decay reconstruction?\",\n\"answer\": \"In the analysis of particle physics experiments, the choice of event samples varies with the particle momentum. Di-photon events are used for efficiency measurement at lower momenta (below 1.5 GeV/c), while J/Ψ and di-muon events are used for higher momenta. This is because different particles have varying characteristics and decay modes depending on their momenta.\n\nFor example, in the case of muon identification efficiency, for particle momenta between 1.0 and 1.5 GeV/c, the muon identification efficiency for the requirement Pμ > 0.5(0.95) GeV/c is 92(89)% with a pion misidentification probability of 5(3)%.\n\nInclusive tagging is a technique used in tau lepton decay reconstruction to expand the search for specific decay channels. Traditional methods relied on one-prong tagging, where one τ decays to μ−μ+μ− and the other τ, named the tag, decays into a final state with a single charged particle. Inclusive tagging, on the other hand, considers a wider range of decays for the tag τ lepton.\n\nBackground rejection strategy and signal efficiency optimization are crucial in analyzing particle physics data. In the context of tau lepton decay reconstruction, background events are suppressed using a cut-based selection or, more advanced techniques like boosted decision trees (BDT). BDTs are machine learning algorithms that can model complex decision boundaries and help distinguish signal events from background events.\n\nTo compare the sensitivity of the inclusive tagging to the traditional one-prong tagging, a validation is performed using a reconstruction method similar to the one used previously by Belle and BaBar experiments. This allows for a more direct comparison and assessment of the improvements gained from using inclusive tagging and optimized signal efficiency techniques.\"\n}", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-003", "page": 6, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "What are the requirements for particles to be retained as part of the ROE and the efficiency of these requirements in suppressing backgrounds?", "answer": "In order to be retained as part of the ROE, photons must have energies of at least 0.2 GeV and tracks must have transverse momenta higher than 0.075 GeV/c, and be displaced from the average interaction point by less than 3 cm along the z axis and less than 1 cm in the transverse plane. Additionally, tracks and photons must lie within the CDC angular acceptance. These requirements help to suppress beam-related backgrounds. \n\nTo further suppress backgrounds, a rectangular region in the (M3µ, ∆E3µ) plane is used for background-rejection optimization, and a 5 δ semi-axis wide, asymmetric elliptical signal region is used for the final yield extraction. The background is primarily due to radiative dilepton and four-lepton final states, incorrectly reconstructed SM e+e−→τ +τ −events, and continuum hadronization processes from e+e−→ qq events, where pions are misidentified as muons. To suppress such backgrounds, two of the muon candidates are required to have Pµ > 0.95, and requirements are placed on the polar angle of the missing momentum and the thrust. These requirements result in an overall signal efficiency of 30.7%.

The trigger efficiency was tested using independent trigger selections on simulated events, resulting in a difference of 0.5% with respect to the absolute efficiency. This difference was added in quadrature to the previous uncertainty. A systematic uncertainty of 1.5% was obtained from the τ−→π−π+π−ντ control sample, which was used to evaluate the BDT selection. The mismodeling of initial state radiation (ISR), final state radiation (FSR), and resolution of the signal extraction variables was accounted for by changing the signal region definition by ±1δ, resulting in a +2.9−3.9% variation of the signal efficiency. Lastly, the number of expected background events was affected by an uncertainty due to imperfections in the magnetic field description and material mismodeling. This was corrected by scaling the momenta of charged particles with a factor of 0.99987, and the corresponding systematic uncertainty was obtained by varying the correction factor according to its uncertainty. The resulting systematic uncertainties were taken as the difference from the nominal value.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-003", "page": 11, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How is the analysis of e+e−→τ+τ− events carried out using one-prong tagging reconstruction, similar to that done previously by Belle and Babar, to select events with four charged particles, mitigate contamination, suppress background components, and optimize muon identification?", "answer": "In this analysis, events containing exactly four charged particles with zero total charge are selected. The charged particles within the tag side are categorized as either leptons (leptonic tag) or hadrons (hadronic tag). The contamination from e+e−→e+e−nh events is mitigated using data-driven requirements: 0.4 < θ∗miss < 2.7 rad for leptonic tags and 0.3 < θ∗miss < 2.8 rad for hadronic tags, along with a requirement that at most one signal track points to the endcaps. These requirements also suppress e+e−→ℓ+ℓ−ℓ+ℓ− and e+e−→e+e−h+h− background components. The e+e−→q¯q background is suppressed by requiring E∗vis, the visible c.m. energy of all reconstructed particles in the event, to be smaller than 10.2 GeV and p∗miss, the missing momentum, to be larger than 0.4 GeV/c. To optimize muon identification, charged particles are separated according to their momentum into three categories: tracks not reaching, partially crossing, or fully crossing the KLM. Selection criteria are optimized independently for the three categories using the Punzi figure-of-merit.

This equation implies that the electric field is proportional to the negative of the rate of change of electric potential with respect to distance.\n\nIn the figure, this relationship is represented by the slope of the line: a steeper slope corresponds to a larger electric field, while a shallower slope corresponds to a smaller electric field.

The η and ω meson candidates are reconstructed in specific decay modes and mass ranges, and the ρ0 or ρ+ meson candidates are formed by combining π+ candidates with π− or π0 candidates in a specific mass range. The charged (neutral) B candidates are reconstructed by combining light meson candidates with selected e+e−or µ+µ−candidates.

This result was obtained by analyzing data collected with the Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB e+e−collider, which has an integrated luminosity of 362±2 fb−1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV. The measurement provides a stringent test of the light-lepton universality, translating to a ratio of the couplings of the muon and electron to the W boson in τ decays of 0.9974 ± 0.0019, which is in agreement with the standard model expectation of unity.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-005", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "Can you explain the general structure of the Belle II detector and simulation study?", "answer": "Certainly! The Belle II experiment is a particle physics experiment that uses the SuperKEKB collider in Japan to produce B mesons and their antiparticles. The goal of the experiment is to study the properties of B mesons and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The Belle II detector is a large, complex instrument that measures the properties of the particles produced in the collisions. The detector is composed of several subdetectors, including a vertex detector, a central drift chamber, an electromagnetic calorimeter, a KLM detector, and a muon system. A simulation study is performed to mimic the behavior of the detector and understand how it responds to different physical processes. The simulation is based on a detailed model of the detector, which takes into account the properties of the materials used in the detector, the geometry of the detector, and the response of the detector to different types of particles. The simulation is used to study the performance of the detector and to develop and optimize the analysis methods used to extract physical measurements from the data. The event selection and analysis methods are carefully designed to select events of interest and reject background events, and systematic uncertainties and consistency checks are performed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-005", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"Can you explain lepton flavor universality (LFU) and its tests in the standard model of particle physics?\",\n\"answer\": \"Lepton flavor universality (LFU) is an intrinsic property in the standard model (SM) of particle physics, which states that the electroweak gauge bosons have the same couplings to the three generations of leptons: e, µ, and τ. This symmetry arises from the fact that the only difference between lepton generations is their distinct masses. However, some SM extensions propose the existence of new particles, such as mediators of new interactions, that couple to the three leptons differently. This makes searches of LFU violation quite compelling.\n\nExperimental tests of LFU have been conducted using various processes, but no significant deviation from the SM expectation has been observed so far. For instance, tests in charged currents have been carried out in the decays of pions, kaons, B mesons, on-shell W bosons, and τ leptons. Among these, the most precise LFU test is achieved in pion decays, followed by τ-lepton decays, which are sensitive not only to charged currents but also to non-SM contributions of weak neutral currents.\n\nLFU tests in τ decays rely on measurements of the τ mass, lifetime, and branching fractions of τ decays to lighter leptons or hadrons.

{"question": "How is the ratio of the effective coupling strengths (gµ/ge)τ between the electron and muon to the W± constrained in the context of the τ lepton decay?", "answer": "The ratio of the effective coupling strengths (gµ/ge)τ between the electron and muon to the W± is constrained by the ratio of the branching fractions Rµ, which is the ratio of the decay rates of the τ lepton into a muon and a neutrino to the decay rate of the τ lepton into an electron and a neutrino. This ratio is given by the equation (1.2) in the content, which takes into account the difference in mass of the final state leptons. The challenge is to accurately determine the ratio of branching fractions Rµ, which deviates from unity in the Standard Model (SM) and is predicted to be 0.9726. Previous measurements of Rµ had a precision limited by systematic uncertainties associated mainly with lepton identification.

{"question": "How are simulated particles generated for studying the e+e−→τ+τ- process in the Belle II experiment and how is the trigger system designed for this measurement?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, simulated particles for the e+e−→τ+τ- process are generated using KKMC for the initial process, TAUOLA for τ decays, and PHOTOS for their radiative corrections. Other processes that contribute to the e+e−→τ+τ- sample as backgrounds are also generated using various software packages, such as PYTHIA, BabaYaga@NLO, AAFH, and TREPS. However, there is currently no generator for e+e−→e+e-Nh processes. The GEANT4 package is used to simulate the response of the detector to the passage of the particles. The trigger system for this measurement is based on ECL energy deposits (clusters) and their topologies in the ECL. The efficiency of the trigger system is driven by the condition that the combined energy deposit of all ECL clusters exceeds 1 GeV. Events with two back-to-back clusters in the centre-of-mass system, one of which exceeds 4.5 GeV and the other 3 GeV, are vetoed by the trigger system to reject Bhabha events.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-005", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are tau-pair candidates selected and how are charged particles and neutral pions identified in the analysis described?", "answer": "In the analysis described, tau-pair candidates are selected by requiring the event to contain exactly two charged particles with zero total charge, each having a trajectory displaced from the average interaction point by less than 3 cm along the z axis and less than 1 cm in the transverse plane. The charged particle on the tag side must satisfy the condition EECL/p ≤0.8 c to suppress electron contamination, while the charged particle on the signal side must be identified as either a muon or an electron using a boosted decision tree classifier. The momenta of charged particles are corrected for imperfections in the magnetic field description, misalignment of the detector, and material mismodelling. Neutral pions are identified as photon pairs with an invariant mass between 120 MeV/c2 and 145 MeV/c2, which is within two units of mass resolution from the known value. Those photons are identified from clusters, reconstructed within the CDC acceptance, 17°< θ < 150°, to ensure they are not matched to any charged particle. The energy threshold for selecting photon candidates varies based on the polar detector region, aiming to suppress beam-induced backgrounds.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-005", "page": 6, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How are e+e−→e+e−Nh background events discriminated and removed in the analysis of τ decays?\",\n\"answer\": \"e+e−→e+e−Nh background events are discriminated using variables such as the thrust value, the squared missing mass M2miss, and the missing transverse momentum p∗T, miss. These variables are chosen because for e+e−→e+e−Nh events, the e+e− pair is not reconstructed and has a momentum vector parallel to the beam axis, while the remaining particles are not collinear. The requirements that the thrust value exceeds 0.85 and M2miss < (20 GeV2/c4 + 40 GeV/c3 · p∗T, miss) are chosen to remove the contribution from e+e−→e+e−Nh events. For all other background processes, simulated signal and background events are used to train a neural network event classifier using cross-entropy as a loss function. The signal sample is defined as the combination of the τ −→e−¯νeντ and τ −→µ−¯νµντ samples to have a common selection for both decays and, as a result, a cancellation of most of the systematic uncertainties on Rµ that are associated with the selection.\"\n}\n\nAdditionally, to select signal events, the output value of the neural network is required to be greater than 0.9, which yields the smallest total uncertainty on Rµ in simulation.

The templates for the signal and background momentum distributions are derived from simulation and use 21 bins spanning the lepton candidate momentum. These templates are then corrected for imperfect simulation of particle identification, neutral particle reconstruction, and trigger efficiency using data-driven corrections. The binning choice is derived from the lepton identification correction bins, with the momentum range covered by seven bins of 0.5 GeV/c width, which are further split into three equal-sized bins to define the templates. The events are separated into channels according to the lepton identification criteria. For each channel, one template represents the signal component, and two templates describe the backgrounds, separated into events with correctly identified leptons and all other background events.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties in the τ −→e−¯νeντ and τ −→µ−¯νµντ decays estimated and accounted for in the analysis?", "answer": "In the analysis of τ −→e−¯νeντ and τ −→µ−¯νµντ decays, several sources of systematic uncertainties are considered and estimated. The systematic uncertainty due to initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR) modeling, as well as reconstruction efficiency of radiated photons, is estimated by varying the number of ISR photons and adding a fraction of FSR photon momenta to the corresponding lepton. This results in an uncertainty of approximately 0.01% for ISR and 0.08% for FSR. Additionally, systematic effects may emerge due to differences in the normalizations of underlying physics processes, such as e+e−→τ +τ −events with misidentified signal or tag sides, and non-τ pair background processes. These normalization differences are assessed by recomputing the templates with varied yields, resulting in a 0.07% uncertainty. To account for possible simulation mismodeling that could alter the shape of the templates, uncertainties are added to each template bin, resulting in 21 nuisance parameters and an overall effect of 0.06% on Rµ. An embedding technique is used to study possible simulation mismodelings of the tag side that might affect the event selection, leading to further refinement in the analysis.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-005", "page": 13, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "What is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, and how is the angle ϕ3 (γ) related to it in the context of the Standard Model (SM) and charge-parity symmetry (CP) violation?", "answer": "The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is a fundamental concept in the Standard Model, describing weak interactions of quarks and accommodating the only source of CP violation. The unitarity of the CKM matrix can be represented as a triangle in the complex plane, with one of its interior angles being ϕ3 (also known as γ). This angle is defined as ϕ3 ≡ arg(−VudV*ub/VcdV*cb), where Vqq′ are CKM matrix elements. The angle ϕ3 is of particular importance because it can be measured directly with negligible theoretical uncertainty through quark-transition amplitudes involving a single W-boson exchange. In the context of the SM, the measurement of ϕ3 serves as an accurate reference for comparing against indirect determinations from global unitarity fits, which can be modified by non-SM particles via transitions involving more than one vector boson. The comparison between direct and indirect determinations is a sensitive probe for the presence of non-SM particles in quark transitions. Currently, the world average of direct measurements is ϕ3 = 66.4+2.8−3.0°, while indirect determinations from the CKMfitter group and UTfit Collaboration are ϕ3 = 66.29+0.72−1.86° and ϕ3 = (65.2 ± 1.5)°, respectively.

The sensitivity to ϕ3 is approximately inversely proportional to the value of rXB, which is around 0.1 for B+ → DK+ decays and 0.005 for B+ → Dπ+ decays.

ADS Method: This method is used for multibody D decays, such as D → K+π−π0. It introduces an extra coherence factor κD to account for the dilution from multiple interfering amplitudes integrated over the D-decay phase space (Dalitz plot). The relevant physics observables are CP-violating decay-rate asymmetries (Af) and CP-averaged decay-rate ratios (Rf). The double ratio (RCP±) is used to reduce systematic uncertainties.

{"question": "What are the considerations made in the measurement of the strong-interaction-phase parameter ϕ3 using Belle and Belle II data, and how are subleading effects and other potential factors addressed?", "answer": "In the measurement of the strong-interaction-phase parameter ϕ3 using Belle and Belle II data, several considerations are made to account for subleading effects and other potential factors. The D → K 0 S h− h+ decay proceeds via several intermediate resonances, leading to a variation of the CP asymmetry over the Dalitz plot, which provides the best sensitivity to ϕ3 among all methods. Subleading effects from D0 − D0 mixing are accounted for in the combination only for the ADS channels, where they contribute at leading order in the relations between ϕ3, other parameters, and the ADS observables RADS and AADS. The magnitude of the effect is inversely proportional to rXB, making it particularly significant for B+ → Dπ+ decays. For consistency, D0−D0 mixing effects are also included for B+ → DK+ modes. The contribution from D0 − D0 mixing cancels in the CP asymmetries and is negligible in the ratios of the GLW observables. Charm mixing is ignored in the BPGGSZ result, as a new measurement would be required to properly account for its effects in the determination of the D-decay strong-interaction-phase parameters. However, the bias from neglecting charm mixing in BPGGSZ channels is estimated to be less than 0.2◦, which is negligible compared to the expected precision of this combination.

{"question": "How do the combined determination of ϕ3 and the full set of results from a study compare to the world average values, and what is the cause of the discrepancy?", "answer": "The combined determination of ϕ3 is consistent with the current world average value within two standard deviations (σ). However, the collective agreement of the full set of results with the world average values is poor, with a p-value of 0.45%. The discrepancy arises primarily from the large values obtained for rDπB and δDπB, which deviate by 2.2σ and 4.0σ, respectively, from the world average values. These parameters are correlated, with a large rDπB value resulting in a smaller uncertainty on δDπB, thus giving a larger deviation for this parameter. The large rDπB value is mainly determined by the values of input observables in Equation 3.1. The study obtains an approximately 1/7 value for the rDπB/rDKB ratio, while the expected value is approximately 1/20, considering only the ratio of CKM matrix-elements involved in the amplitudes.

The large δDπB value, favored by Belle and Belle II measurements, leads to a precise determination of cos(δDπB + δKπD) close to one. The small relative uncertainty of the large rDπB value, the precise value of rKπD from global averages, and the large δDπB value collectively contribute to the improved precision of the ADS sensitivity to ϕ3. The impact of a large rDKB value, which is 1.5σ higher than the world average, is also checked. By repeating the analysis with simulated experiments assuming world average values for ϕ3 and hadronic parameters, the precision improves to 10.1° when using the combined value of rDKB.

{"question": "What is the reported value of the CKM angle ϕ3 and how does it compare to the world average value?", "answer": "The reported value of the CKM angle ϕ3, after combining existing Belle and Belle II measurements and auxiliary D-decay information from other experiments, is (75.2 ± 7.6)°. This value is consistent with the world average value within 1.1σ [9]. The parameters rDK^B, rDπ^B, and δDπ^B have higher values compared to the world average values, with deviations of 1.5σ, 2.2σ, and 4.0σ, respectively. These differences are likely due to the large measured value of rDπ^B.

{"question": "What is the correlation matrix of the statistical uncertainties for the B+ → Dh+, D → K0 SK−π+ observables?", "answer": "In the context of statistical analysis in physics, a correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients between different observables. For the B+ → Dh+, D → K0 SK−π+ decay process, the correlation matrix of the statistical uncertainties is presented in Table 16. However, the actual content of Table 16 has not been provided in your question. Nonetheless, I can explain how to interpret such a table.\n\nA correlation matrix is a square matrix, where the element in the i-th row and j-th column (denoted as [i,j]) represents the correlation coefficient between the i-th and j-th observables. The correlation coefficient typically ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 1 implies a strong positive correlation, while a value of -1 implies a strong negative correlation. A value of 0 implies no correlation between the observables.\n\nFor example, if we have a correlation matrix as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.5 & -0.3 \\\\ 0.5 & 1 & 0.7 \\\\ -0.3 & 0.7 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThis matrix indicates that the first observable has a strong positive correlation with the second observable (0.5), a moderate negative correlation with the third observable (-0.3), and so on. It is important to note that the correlation matrix is symmetric, i.e., the correlation between observable i and j is the same as the correlation between observable j and i ([i,j] = [j,i]).", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-006", "page": 31, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How does the standard model of particle physics fail to provide a complete description of nature and what are some proposed solutions?", "answer": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics, although highly predictive, is known to provide an incomplete description of nature. For example, it does not address the phenomenology related to dark matter, such as the observed relic density. Additionally, some experimental observations show inconsistencies with the SM, such as the difference between the measured and expected value of the muon anomalous magnetic-moment (g −2)µ, and tensions in flavor observables reported by the BABAR, Belle, and LHCb experiments. Some of these observations can be explained with the introduction of additional interactions, possibly lepton-universality-violating, mediated by non-SM neutral bosons. Examples include the Lµ −Lτ extension of the SM and a muonphilic scalar model. The Lµ −Lτ extension of the SM gauges the difference between the muon and the τ-lepton numbers, giving rise to a new massive, neutral vector boson, the Z′. The Z′ could also mediate interactions between SM and dark matter. The muonphilic scalar S is primarily proposed as a solution for the (g −2)µ anomaly and couples exclusively to muons through a Yukawa-like interaction.

{"question": "How does the analysis of the four-muon system proceed and what are the reasons for the discrepancies between data and simulation in the resulting candidate M(µµ) distribution?", "answer": "The analysis of the four-muon system involves selecting events where the total energy of all photons is less than the expected energy of a single irradiated photon, which depends linearly on M(4µ). Additionally, events are rejected if the angle in the center-of-mass frame between the momentum of the four-muon system and that of the system composed of all the photons is larger than 160°. Each event includes four possible µ+µ−candidates, causing some combinatorial background. The resulting candidate M(µµ) distribution is then considered for each µ+µ−candidate with its recoil muons. The average data-to-simulation yield ratio is 0.76, which is due to the lack of Initial State Radiation (ISR) in the AAFH four-muon generator, consistent with previous reports from Babar [19] and Belle [20].

The double-photon-conversion process, which accounts for a significant portion of the four-muon background cross section, is sensitive to the transverse momentum of the candidate muon pair with respect to the beam direction, as well as the transverse momentum of the candidate muon pair with respect to the direction of the recoil muon with minimum momentum.

{"question": "How are multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks used in the analysis of Belle II simulation data for candidate muon pairs with dimuon masses between 2.75 GeV/c² and 3.25 GeV/c², and what are the input variables and MLP ranges used?", "answer": "In the analysis of Belle II simulation data, multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks with 16 input neurons and one output neuron are used to distinguish signal events (mZ′ = 3 GeV/c² from simulated Z′) from background events. The input variables for the MLPs are the transverse momentum of the candidate muon pair with respect to the minimum momentum recoil-muon direction (pT(pµµ, precmin)), the transverse momentum of the candidate muon pair with respect to the z-axis (pT(pµµ, z)), and the transverse projections of the recoil-muon-pair momentum on the directions of the momenta of the candidate muons with minimum and maximum momentum. These variables are defined in the center-of-mass (c.m.) frame. To improve performance, five separate MLPs are used in different M(µµ) intervals, or MLP ranges: 0.21-1.00 GeV/c², 1.00-1.50 GeV/c², 1.50-2.00 GeV/c², 2.00-2.50 GeV/c², and 2.50-3.50 GeV/c².

{"question": "How is the performance of MLPs (Multi-Layer Perceptrons) optimized in the given momentum ranges and what is the background rejection factor achieved by the MLP selection?", "answer": "The performance of MLPs in the 3.75-6.25 GeV/c2, 6.25-8.25 GeV/c2, and 8.25-10.00 GeV/c2 momentum ranges is optimized by reducing the dependence of input variables on mZ′. This is achieved by scaling the momentum-dimensioned variables by p0, the maximum center-of-mass momentum of the two muon pairs. A training signal sample with mass steps of 5 MeV/c2 is used to approximate a continuous distribution and avoid biasing MLPs to specific mass values. The most discriminating variable is found to be pµµ, followed by the correlation of pµ+ and pµ−. The background rejection factor achieved by the MLP selection varies from 2.5 to 14, with the best value around 5 GeV/c2. The resulting background is primarily composed of e+e−→µ+µ−µ+µ− events, with e+e−→µ+µ−(γ) and e+e−→e+e−µ+µ− processes contributing only below 1 GeV/c2.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-007", "page": 6, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How do the signal efficiencies of the Z' and S bosons compare in the Belle II simulation for the Lµ−Lτ and muonphilic scalar models, and what is the effect of ISR on these efficiencies?", "answer": "The signal efficiencies of the Z' and S bosons are compared in the Belle II simulation for the Lµ−Lτ and muonphilic scalar models in Figure 10. The S boson, due to angular momentum conservation, is produced through a p-wave process and has a higher momentum spectrum than the Z', which is produced via an s-wave process. For masses below 1 GeV/c2, this implies the presence of higher momentum muons in the case of the scalar, which are better identified and detected with higher efficiency. However, for masses above 1 GeV/c2, the muon identification efficiencies for S and Z' are similar. The signal efficiencies shown in the figure are corrected for ISR. Although the signal generator includes ISR, it does not include the large-angle hard-radiation component that can produce photons in the acceptance, and thereby veto events. This effect is studied using e+e−→µ+µ−γ events, generated with KKMC that simulates ISR in a complete way. A relative reduction of 2.8% in efficiency is observed due to ISR, which is taken into account in the simulation.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-007", "page": 7, "chunk_type": "text"}

The uncertainties due to tracking efficiency are estimated to be 3.6% in e+e−→τ +τ −events. The uncertainties due to the muon identification requirement vary between 0.7% and 3%, depending on the X mass. Beam backgrounds in the calorimeter can accidentally veto events, and the relative uncertainty on the signal efficiency due to this source is estimated to be below 1%. To evaluate uncertainties due to data-to-simulation discrepancies in MLP selection efficiencies, differences found in each MLP range vary between 1.1% and 8.1%, which are taken as estimates of the systematic uncertainties.

This allows for each final-state particle to be uniquely associated with one of the two B mesons and increases the signal purity.

Signal-lepton candidates are selected from charged-particle trajectories remaining after the Btag reconstruction, with requirements on the lepton charge, angular acceptance, and pointing back to the interaction point. Muon and electron candidates have specific identification criteria and efficiency measurements. In 3% of events, two or more signal-lepton candidates pass these selections, and the candidate with the highest identification likelihood is selected.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How are uncertainties and correlations incorporated in the yield of various B meson decay processes in the given context?\",\n\"answer\": \"In the given context, uncertainties are incorporated in the yield of various B meson decay processes in several ways. Initially, uncertainties are assumed to be fully correlated for events in the same MX (or (pℓ, MX), for BB background) bin and uncorrelated otherwise. However, branching-fraction uncertainties are introduced by deriving efficiency uncertainties and bin covariances based on histogram shape differences caused by their ±1σ variations. For B →Xuℓν and B →D(∗)ℓν decays, latest values are used, combining the results of neutral and charged B mesons under the assumption of isospin symmetry. The remaining b →cℓν decays, not all final states have been measured, are estimated using isospin symmetry. Among the nonresonant gap modes, only the decay B →D(∗)π+π−ℓν is measured, and the result is extrapolated to the other charge configurations to estimate their total branching fractions. The remaining gap modes, B →D(∗)ηℓν, are assigned a 100% branching fraction uncertainty. Decay-model parameters (form factors) are varied according to their covariances using the HAMMER software package. The full differences between the BL-PRXP parameter prediction and parametrizations using the BGL (CLN) model are treated as additional uncertainties for B →D(∗)ℓν (B →D(∗)τν) processes.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How do the reweightings affect the agreement between experimental and simulated data in the context of B-meson decays, and how is R(Xτ/ℓ)exp related to R(D(∗)) anomalies?\",\n\"answer\": \"Reweightings in the simulation of B-meson decays, such as MX and (pℓ, MX)-based reweightings of Xℓν and BB background events, can improve the agreement between experimental and simulated data. This improvement is best quantified by the normalized residuals, which are the difference between simulated and experimental yields divided by the quadrature sum of their statistical uncertainties. The reweightings have a negligible effect on the pBℓ shape for B →Xcℓν events, but modify the shape of the component for BB backgrounds in the same-flavor control sample, leading to modest improvements in the low-pBℓ region after reweighting. The remaining three quantities, MX, M2miss, and q2, which depend directly on the calibration quantity MX, show large and simultaneous improvements after reweighting, suggesting that the reweightings mitigate underlying modeling errors. The multiplicities of charged kaons, charged pions, and photons also improve after reweighting. These improvements have been observed in various signal-depleted control regions, supporting the validity of the reweightings in all kinematic regions. \\n\\nTo understand the relationship between R(Xτ/ℓ)exp and R(D(∗)) anomalies, it is essential to control for the variety of additional decays included in B →Xτ(ℓ)ν. The measured light-lepton branching fractions B(B →Dℓν), B(B →D∗ℓν), and B(B →Xℓν) are needed. The standard model prediction of R(Xτ/ℓ) is calculated using Refs. [21, 22, 41], while Ref. [45] provides the theoretical input for either fully inclusive R(Xτ/ℓ) or R(Xu). The average predicted R(Xτ/ℓ) value is then used to derive R(Xτ/ℓ)SM and B(B →Xτν).

{"question": "Can you describe the Belle II detector, its data collection process, and the event selection criteria used in the analysis of Υ(10753) events?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is a nearly 4π spectrometer located at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider at KEK. It consists of silicon-based vertexing and drift- chamber tracking systems, Cherenkov-light particle identification detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, a superconducting solenoid providing a 1.5 T axial magnetic field, and a flux return instrumented for K0L and muon detection. The detector collects data at various energy points, including the peak of the e+e−→Υ(4S) production cross section at √s = 10.58 GeV and above the Υ(4S) resonance at √s = 10.653, 10.701, 10.746, and 10.805 GeV.

{"question": "How are Υ(nS) candidates reconstructed and selected in the analysis described?", "answer": "In the analysis described, Υ(nS) candidates are reconstructed by decaying to a pair of oppositely charged particles each with a momentum in the e+e−c.m. frame in the range 4.2 < p∗(µ) < 5.35 GeV/c. At least one track is required to have a muon identification likelihood ratio L(µ)/(L(e) + L(µ) + L(K) + L(π) + L(p) + L(d)) > 0.9, corresponding to a selection efficiency of about 95% and a π −µ misidentification rate around 5%. The µ+µ−pair, π+π−pair, and the overall π+π−µ+µ−candidate are individually fitted and constrained to originate from the same vertex. Poorly reconstructed events are rejected by requiring the momentum of the signal candidates in the e+e−c.m. frame p∗(π+π−µ+µ−) to be less than 100 MeV/c. Signal yields are extracted by defining the difference of the overall candidate invariant mass and the Υ(nS) candidate invariant mass as ∆M = M(π+π−µ+µ−) −M(µ+µ−), which helps to improve the mass resolution. The selection criteria are optimized using the figure-of-merit ϵP /(a + √NB), where ϵP is the simulated signal efficiency and NB is the number of background events determined from data sidebands. The sidebands are defined as the region more than 10 standard deviations (σ) in resolution of the Υ(10753) signal away from the expected signal region in the ∆M dimension.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-009", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}

These conditions can change due to variations in the beam intensity, beam energy, or the quality of the vacuum in the beam pipe. As a result, the data collected under different beam-induced background conditions may have different levels of background noise and systematic uncertainties, which can affect the accuracy and precision of the physical measurements.\n\nISR reweighting is a technique used to correct for the effects of Initial State Radiation, which can alter the energy and momentum of the particles produced in the collisions. The ISR reweighting factors can depend on the collision energy, the scattering angle, and other kinematic variables. Therefore, the ISR reweighting may differ at each energy point due to the different collision kinematics and radiation patterns at different energies.\n\nIn summary, the differing beam-induced background conditions and ISR reweighting at each energy point during the data-taking period are due to the complex and dynamic nature of high-energy particle collisions, which require careful analysis and correction to extract meaningful physical results.\"\n}", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-009", "page": 10, "chunk_type": "text"}

The measurement focuses on two ranges of K0Sπ0 invariant mass: m(K0Sπ0) ∈(0.8, 1.0) GeV/c2, which is dominated by B0 → K∗0(→K0Sπ0)γ decays, and a complementary region m(K0Sπ0) ∈(0.6, 0.8) ∪ (1.0, 1.8) GeV/c2. The results have improved precision compared to previous measurements and are consistent with theory predictions. The measurement is significant for probing physics beyond the Standard Model, as the radiative process b →sγ proceeds mainly via a loop amplitude and is sensitive to new physics. The polarization of the final-state photon adds unique sensitivity to physics beyond the SM. In the SM, the outgoing photon from a B0 decay must have negative helicity, while in BSM physics, a B0 (B0) could more easily emit negative (positive) helicity photons, leading to sizable interference and O(0.1) mixing-induced CP violation. The Belle II experiment records data at the SuperKEKB collider, which collides 7.0 GeV electrons with 4.0 GeV positrons.

The flavor of Btag is determined using a combination of BDT algorithms, and the data is divided into seven r bins, each containing a similar number of events. The wrong-tag fraction w and the difference ∆w between B0 and B0 tags are determined for each r bin using a sample of flavor-specific B decays. The effective tagging efficiency, εeff, is (31.69 ± 0.35)%. Two BDT classifiers are trained to discriminate signal from qq background, separately for MR1 and MR2 candidates. The signal and background yields are determined using an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to the two-dimensional Mbc–∆E distribution, where Mbc and ∆E are the beam-constrained mass and energy difference, respectively. The fit is performed in the ranges 5.23 GeV/c2 < Mbc < 5.29 GeV/c2 and −0.4 GeV < ∆E < 0.3 GeV, combining the TD and TI samples.

{"question": "How are the resolution functions Rsig and RBB modeled in the analysis of Belle II data, and how are the detector resolution and bias accounted for in these models?", "answer": "In the analysis of Belle II data, the resolution functions Rsig and RBB are modeled by convolving three components: detector resolution for Bsig and Btag decay vertices, bias due to the secondary decay vertex of intermediate charm states in Btag decays, and a correction to the boost factors due to the small momenta of the B mesons in the c.m. frame. This last component depends on cos θ∗B, where θ∗B is the angle in the c.m. frame between the B0 momentum and the Υ(4S) boost direction. The detector resolution for Bsig (Btag) vertex is modeled on an event-by-event basis, including the dependence on σℓsig (σℓtag) and the χ2 from the vertex fit. The resolution function parameters are determined from MC samples that have been generated with track helix parameters calibrated from data. The data used consist of cosmic ray events in which a cosmic ray track traversing the PXD or SVD is reconstructed as two outgoing tracks from the IP. For BB background, the Bsig vertex resolution is the same as that of the signal component due to the high purity of K0S candidates, while the Btag vertex suffers from contamination by tracks coming from the background Bsig decay. The vertex resolution for BB background is adjusted in PBB and the parameters of the BB resolution function are adjusted to account for the smeared vertex position and the typically shorter decay time difference. The vertex resolution for BB background is modeled using three Gaussian functions, whose shape parameters are determined from a fit to an Mbc–∆E sideband in data defined as 5.23 GeV/c2 < Mbc < 5.255 GeV/c2, −0.5 GeV < ∆E < 0.3 GeV, and (Mbc −5.23 GeV/c2) < (∆E + 0.45 GeV)/14c2.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-010", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "What are the details of the π0 BDT classifier used for identifying Bsig candidates in the physics analysis, and how is it trained?", "answer": "The π0 BDT (Boosted Decision Tree) classifier used in the physics analysis to identify Bsig candidates is trained using simulated samples consisting of approximately 180 000 true and misreconstructed π0 candidates. These candidates are required to satisfy certain selection criteria, including a specific range for the invariant mass of the γγ system and a minimum transverse momentum. The BDT classifier is trained using nine variables, including the energies of both γ candidates, properties of the ECL cluster of the less energetic γ, the helicity angle and the invariant mass of the π0, and the MVA output for γ–K0L separation using Zernike moments. The BDT output for signal and background is shown in Figure 3.

{"question": "How does the GFlaT algorithm improve upon previous Belle II algorithms for determining the flavor of neutral B mesons produced in Υ(4S) decays?", "answer": "The GFlaT algorithm is a new approach introduced by the Belle II Collaboration that uses a graph-neural-network to determine the flavor of neutral B mesons produced in Υ(4S) decays. This method surpasses previous algorithms by utilizing information from all charged final-state particles and considering the relationships between them. This more comprehensive analysis leads to an effective tagging efficiency of (37.40 ± 0.43 ± 0.36) %, which is 18% better than the previous Belle II algorithm. The GFlaT algorithm was tested using B decays to flavor-specific hadronic final states in a 362 fb−1 sample of electron-positron collisions collected at the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB collider. The algorithm was further demonstrated to accurately measure the mixing-induced and direct CP violation parameters, S and C, in B0 →J/ψK0S decays.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-012", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}

This approach allows GFlaT to account for discarded information in the category-based flavor tagger and correlations between information from final-state particles. GFlaT is used to measure the CP parameters of B0 →J/ψK0S decays, from which the angle ϕ1 can be calculated. The probability density to observe a Bsig decay at a time ∆t from when Btag decays with flavor qtag is given by the equation P(∆t, qtag) = e−|∆t|/τ \t\n1 + qtag(1 −2w)[S sin(∆md∆t) −C cos(∆md∆t)] , where qtag is determined by the flavor tagger, w is the probability to wrongly determine it, τ is the B0 life-time, and ∆md is the difference of masses of the B0 mass eigenstates. In the standard model, S = sin 2ϕ1 and C = 0 to good precision. The B mesons are boosted and have significant momentum in the lab frame, so ∆t is determined from the relative displacement of their decay vertices.

{"question": "How does the GFlat flavor tagger in Belle II experiment work and what are its input variables?", "answer": "The GFlat flavor tagger in the Belle II experiment is designed to run after the Bsig reconstruction and uses information from tracks and energy deposits in the ECL (clusters) not associated with Bsig, referred to as the rest of the event (ROE). The ROE tracks must be within the Central Drift Chamber (CDC) and have points of closest approach (POCAs) to the interaction region (IR) that are within 3 cm from the IR in the z direction and within 1 cm from it in the transverse plane. The shape and location of the IR are determined from e+e−→µ+µ−events in 30-minute intervals. Only the first 16 charged particles in the ROE, ordered by decreasing momentum in the lab frame, are retained. According to simulation, the average number of charged particles in the ROE is 4.8, and less than 0.001% of events have more than 16 charged particles. GFlat uses 25 input variables for each ROE charged particle, including the lab-frame Cartesian components of its momentum and the displacement of its POCA from the IR, particle-identification likelihoods for each of the six possible charged final-state particles (e, µ, π, K, proton, and deuteron), and the products of the charge of the particle and the output of the category-based flavor tagger for each of its 13 categories. The input variables have the same distributions for B0 and B0bar, except for differences corresponding to qcandycat defined in Ref.

{"question": "How does GFlaT, a dynamic-graph-convolutional-neural-network, improve the detection and reconstruction efficiency for charged particles compared to the category-based flavor tagger?", "answer": "GFlaT uses a dynamic-graph-convolutional-neural-network that consists of the EdgeConv algorithm, which has three neural networks: edge and node networks running in parallel, and a weight network. The network processes the input variables of each pair of particles to update the variables of each particle. GFlaT runs EdgeConv twice, with the first run processing the measured particle variables and the second run processing the output of the first run. The output variables of each particle from the second EdgeConv are multiplied by its charge to keep the output reasonably symmetric between B0 and B0. GFlaT better distinguishes between B0 and B0 than the category-based flavor tagger due to its ability to account for the relationships between final-state particles, which allows it to better discern the origin of the tracks. This results in higher peaks at |qr| ≈1 and smaller bumps at |qr| ≈0 and |qr| ≈0.65. GFlaT also exhibits a visible improvement in performance for events with neither a charged lepton nor a charged kaon, which consist mostly of pions. The GFlaT algorithm exploits the correlation between a charged pion from B0 decay and the B flavor more effectively to improve performance.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-012", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}

The D(∗)− candidate is formed by combining a D− candidate with a π−, where the D− candidate is required to have a mass within a ±3σ range around the known D− mass. The D0 candidate, which is a decay product of D(∗)−, is reconstructed from K+π−, K+π−π0, or K+π−π+π−, with each candidate's mass falling within a specific range around the known D0 mass. The π− from the D∗− candidate decay must have momentum below 300 MeV in the e+e− center-of-mass frame, and the D∗− candidate must have an energy release within a certain range. After reconstructing the B0 candidates, their trajectories and momenta are fitted according to the decay chain, and candidates with poorly converging fits are rejected. The signal region is defined using beam-constrained mass (Mbc) and energy difference (∆E) criteria, and only candidates that satisfy these criteria are selected for further analysis.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-012", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How is the decay position of Btag determined and how are signal events separated from background events in the study you mentioned?", "answer": "In the study, the decay position of Btag is determined by fitting the trajectories of ROE tracks with Rave. Unlike TreeFit, Rave accounts for the unknown Btag decay chain by reducing the impact of a displaced vertex due to potential intermediate D's, constraining the Btag vertex position to be consistent with the origin and direction of Bsig. Events in which this fit does not converge, which is about 3.4% of the signal events, are rejected.\n\nTo separate signal from background, an extended unbinned likelihood fit is performed on the ∆E distribution, combining data from Bsig and Bsig and all r intervals. The signal contribution is modeled as the sum of a Gaussian function and a double-sided Crystal-Ball function, with their parameters and admixture fixed to values obtained from fitting to simulated data. A common shift of their peak values and common scaling of their widths are left free to account for differences between data and simulation.\n\nEvents in which Bsig decays to the D(∗)−K+ final state, with the K+ misidentified as a π+, peak at −50 MeV in the ∆E distribution. This contribution is modeled as a double-sided Crystal Ball function, with its parameters fixed to values obtained from fitting to simulated data, including the ratio of its yield to the signal. Since these events have the same ∆t distribution as B0 →D(∗)−π+, they are used as signal in the sWeight calculation.\n\nThe BB background contribution is modeled as a second-order polynomial, with the ratio of its yield to that of the signal fixed to a value obtained from simulated data. The qq background contribution is modeled as an exponential function. The parameters of the qq component are constrained by simultaneously fitting to the ∆E distribution in a sideband, Mbc ∈[5.20, 5.24] GeV, populated predominantly by qq events.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-012", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How is the Δt measurement calculated and what are the components of the resolution function in the given particle physics analysis?", "answer": "In the given particle physics analysis, Δt is calculated using the formula Δt = Δℓ/βγγB, where Δℓ is the distance of the Bsig vertex from the Btag vertex along the Υ(4S) boost direction, βγ is the Lorentz boost of the Υ(4S) in the lab frame, and γB is the Lorentz factor of the B in the center-of-mass frame. The resolution and bias in measuring Δℓ are accounted for by convolving the equation with a resolution function, which consists of a core component modeled by a Gaussian function, a tail component modeled by a weighted sum of Gaussian and exponentially modified Gaussian functions, and an outlier component modeled by a Gaussian function. The parameters of the resolution function are shared by all r bins, except for the highest r bin, which is mostly populated by semileptonic Btag decays. The resolution function has a total of seven free parameters and is used to fit to the binned background-subtracted Δt distributions in 28 subsets of the data defined by the 7 r intervals, 2 flavors of Bsig, and 2 flavors of Btag. The uncertainty on the Δt measurement, σΔt, is computed for each event and is a conditional variable in the resolution function.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties determined for the B0 → J/ψK0 and B0 → D(∗)−π+ decays in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, systematic uncertainties for the B0 → J/ψK0 and B0 → D(∗)−π+ decays are determined through various methods. For B0 → J/ψK0 S, the uncertainty from background subtraction is accounted for in the ∆t-fit bias. In the case of B0 → D(∗)−π+, the uncertainty in background subtraction is determined by replacing ∆t distributions with those from simulated B0 → D(∗)−π+ data that either contain signal events or signal and background events with background subtraction using sWeight. The differences in the results are taken as systematic uncertainties, which is the dominant systematic uncertainty on εtag. Uncertainties on ∆t-fit shape parameters, τ, and ∆md directly propagate to changes in εtag, S, and C, and are taken as systematic uncertainties. The number of bins for the σ∆t histogrammed probability density functions is varied between 200 and 1000, and the largest changes are taken as systematic uncertainties. Biases in ∆t fits are determined from fits to simulated data sets, and their quadratic sums are taken as systematic uncertainties. A systematic uncertainty from CP violation in Btag decays is determined in Ref. [3], which is the dominant systematic uncertainty on C. This uncertainty can be significantly reduced by performing a combined measurement of C and S in CP-odd and CP-even decays. Statistical uncertainties on GFlaT's parameters and resolution-function parameters are propagated to uncertainties on S and C by repeating the fits for each B0 → D(∗)−π+ bootstrap sample.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-012", "page": 9, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "What is the role of semileptonic B decays and the measurement of R(D*) in the context of the Standard Model and physics beyond the Standard Model?", "answer": "Semileptonic B decays, such as B →D(∗)ℓ−νℓ, are an important part of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. They are mediated by a W boson and involve b →c or b →u transitions, which are described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element Vcb. Hadronic effects are also included in the decay rate and are described by hadronic matrix elements, which are parametrized in terms of form factors in the context of heavy quark effective theory (HQET). The SM assumes lepton flavor universality (LFU), meaning that the W boson couples equally to the three lepton generations. This symmetry can be tested by measuring the ratio R(D*) = B(B →D∗τ −ντ) / B(B →D∗ℓ−νℓ), where the denominator is the normalization mode with ℓ= e or µ. Semileptonic B decays involving a τ lepton are sensitive to physics beyond the SM (BSM) and their decays are less constrained by data than semileptonic decays to electrons and muons. The cancelation of |Vcb| and many theoretical and experimental uncertainties in the R(D*) ratios make these measurements stringent LFU tests, which are often combined. The world averages of these measurements, R(D) = 0.356 ± 0.029 and R(D*) = 0.284 ± 0.013, exceed the SM expectation by 2.0σ and 2.2σ, respectively.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"Can you describe the process of generating and using Monte Carlo simulation samples in the context of B meson decays and the Belle II experiment?\",\n\"answer\": \"Sure, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples are used to develop signal selection criteria, examine background processes, and determine fit models in the analysis of B meson decays in the Belle II experiment. The decay chains are simulated using the EvtGen package and the detector response is modeled with the Geant4 framework. These samples consist of e+e−→BB events where each B meson decays inclusively or continuum events (e+e−→qq decays where q is a u, d, c, or s quark). The decay rates of B meson decays for which no measurements exist are modeled by PYTHIA. The luminosity of the BB and continuum samples is 0.9 ab−1 and 1.0 ab−1, respectively. A sample of 800 million simulated signal events is also generated where one B meson decays exclusively to D(∗)τντ and the other B meson decays inclusively. The branching fractions of the D meson decays used in the simulation are corrected to match the known values and the branching fractions of the hadronic B decays are also corrected. The D∗∗ states, which are a leading background in this measurement, are described in the simulation using an isospin factor of 2/3 to compute the overall branching fraction of D∗∗ decays to two-body final states. The B →D∗2ℓ−νℓ branching fractions are computed using the B(D∗2 →Dπ−)/B(D∗2 →D∗π−) observed average and the B →D1ℓ−ν branching fractions are estimated using measurements of the partial branching fractions with two-body D1 final states. The nonresonant components are simulated assuming they come from the broad D∗0 and D′1 resonances in equal fractions and their branching fractions are consistent with zero once the resonant decay contributions are subtracted from the inclusive branching fractions. Consequently, these nonresonant branching fractions are set to zero.

{"question": "How are photon candidates selected and what requirements are applied to reconstruct π0 and K0S mesons in the B → D(∗)π(ℓ−ν) decays simulation?", "answer": "Photon candidates in the B → D(∗)π(ℓ−ν) decays simulation are selected by applying an optimized requirement based on the relation (∆TC/X)2 + (Z0/Y )2 > 1 for each D(∗) decay mode and for each of the forward endcap, barrel, and backward endcap regions. Here, ∆TC is the distance of each photon to the nearest track extrapolated to the ECL, Z0 is an electromagnetic shower shape-based classifier variable determined using 11 Zernike moments in the ECL, and X and Y are chosen to maximize the figure of merit (FOM). For the low-momentum π0 daughter of the D∗, an additional requirement on the energy asymmetry (AE) is applied, and a less restrictive cluster-energy requirement is applied for the low-momentum π0 in D∗0 decays. Candidate π0 mesons are reconstructed via π0 → γγ decays, where additional requirements are applied on the photons to further reduce background from misreconstructed candidates. The mass of the reconstructed π0 candidates must lie within specific intervals for the D0 and D∗ daughters. For the K0S mesons, which are reconstructed in their K0S → π−π+ decays, a FastBDT classifier is employed to discriminate K0S candidates from π+π− combinatorial background and Λ0 baryon decays to pπ−. The classifier returns two K0S probabilities, PK0S and PΛ0-veto, and requirements are applied on these probabilities, the reconstructed K0S invariant mass, and its flight length from the IP.

The PID selection has an efficiency of 84.6% and 87.7% for electrons and muons, respectively, and a misidentification rate of 1.0% and 4.8%, respectively. A vertex fit is then applied to the D*ℓ combination, and any Bsig candidate that fails this fit is discarded. For all successful Bsig candidates, a secondary vertex fit is applied to improve the resolution of M^2miss. The Bsig candidates that fail the second fit are also discarded. The candidate Bsig is then combined with the Btag to form an Υ(4S) candidate, and the signal region is defined as q2 > 4.0 (GeV/c)2. After the reconstruction of Υ(4S) candidates, all remaining tracks and clusters are attributed to the rest-of-the-event (ROE), and any Υ(4S) candidate with one or more residual ROE tracks is discarded.

For the background categories, the uncertainties are obtained by varying the normalization factors by ±1σ and observing the resulting differences in the probability density function (PDF) shapes. The total systematic uncertainty for the background categories is a quadratic sum of the individual sources, which amounts to +2.7% −2.3%.\\\n\\\nA similar procedure is followed for the hadronic B decay background composition, where the branching fractions of $B → D^∗D(∗)_s$ and $B → D^∗nπ(π0)$ decays are varied according to a single Gaussian distribution. The correlation for $B → D^∗D(∗)_s$ decays takes into account the systematic variation due to cross feed in the branching fraction measurement. Contributions of hadronic B decays that are not measured are also varied from 0% to 200% of their estimated branching fraction. The total uncertainty from all hadronic B decays is 2.1%, which is the quadratic sum of the individual sources.\\\n\\\nSystematic uncertainties from various efficiency corrections applied to the signal and normalization channels are determined by varying each efficiency correction by ±1σ and adding the resulting differences in quadrature. This results in a systematic uncertainty of 2.0%.\\\n\\\nThe systematic uncertainty associated with the KDE is determined by fitting the PDFs after the KDE to simplified simulated experiments where KDE is not applied. The fit is repeated for 1000 simplified simulated experiments, and the observed shift in the ∆R(D∗) distribution is taken as the systematic uncertainty of +2.0% −0.8%.\\\n\\\nLastly, the systematic uncertainty associated with the form factors for the semileptonic B decay models used in the simulation is determined by constructing covariance matrices for each signal $D^*$ decay and each category of semileptonic B decays. An alternative PDF is then constructed by random sampling from the resulting covariance matrices.

The obtained upper limit on σB(ηb(1S)ω) is close to the measured values of σB(Υ(nS)π+π−), which are in the range (1 −3) pb, and does not support the tetraquark-model prediction that the Υ(10753) → ηb(1S)ω decay is enhanced. The upper limit on the χb0(1P)ω cross section is higher than the measured χb1(1P)ω and χb2(1P)ω cross sections, but is consistent with the expectation for a 4S −3D mixed state. In the charmonium sector, the decay of the Y (4230) state to χc0ω is enhanced compared to the decays to χc1ω and χc2ω, while no analogous enhancement is found in the decay pattern of Υ(10753), which may indicate different structures for Y (4230) and Υ(10753).", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-014", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}

The tracks are required to originate from near the interaction point (IP) with a displacement of |δz| < 2.0 cm and δr < 0.5 cm. The IP position is measured at regular intervals of data-taking using e+e−→µ+µ−events, with a typical spread of 250 µm in the z direction, 10 µm in the transverse horizontal direction (x), and only 0.3 µm in the transverse vertical direction (y). Tracks are identified as pions or kaons based on Cherenkov light recorded in the TOP and ARICH, and specific ionization (dE/dx) information from the CDC and SVD. To reconstruct ϕ → K+K− decays, two kaon candidate tracks with opposite charge and an invariant mass of 1.010 GeV/c2 < M(K+K−) < 1.030 GeV/c2 are combined.

There are two types of data sets: collision data, which are collected when electrons and positrons are collided, and background data, which are collected when the beam is dumped or during beam collisions without physics interest. The collision data are used to measure the physical quantities of interest, while the background data are used to estimate the background contributions. The data sets are usually divided into different periods, depending on the running conditions and the performance of the detector.

This observation was based on energy scan data with gaps between the data points. In order to improve understanding of the Υ(10753) energy region, the SuperKEKB collider performed an energy scan in November 2021, and the Belle II experiment collected data at four center-of-mass (c.m.) energies with integrated luminosities shown in Table 1.

Additionally, Belle II observed a strong enhancement of the e+e−→χbJ(1P) ω (J = 1, 2) cross sections in the Υ(10753) region, establishing the Υ(10753) →χb1(1P) ω decay channel.

{"question": "How is the B meson reconstructed and the signals identified in the analysis performed by Belle II using the scan data?", "answer": "In the analysis conducted by Belle II, the B meson is reconstructed in hadronic channels by performing a full reconstruction of one B meson. The signals are then identified as B ¯B, B ¯B∗, and B∗¯B∗ using the Mbc distribution, which is given by the equation Mbc = q(Ecm/2)2 −p2B, where Ecm is the c.m. energy of the colliding beams and pB is the B-candidate momentum in the c.m. frame. Photons from B∗→Bγ decays are not reconstructed. The B mesons are reconstructed in a large number of hadronic final states using the multivariate full event interpretation (FEI) algorithm. The FEI configuration is optimized for energy-scan analyses, with the optimization primarily concerning FEI inputs to make the reconstruction efficiency independent of energy. The ∆E variable is not included in the training and a sideband in the (Mbc, ∆E) plane is used to constrain backgrounds. The ∆E variable is defined as ∆E = EB −Ecm/2, where EB is the B-candidate energy measured in the c.m. frame. The absolute value of the reconstruction efficiency is determined using Υ(4S) data. In the Mbc fits, the signals are described using a function developed in Ref. [8] that is calculated numerically and includes all relevant effects, such as initial-state radiation (ISR) and the energy dependence of the cross sections.

{"question": "How are lepton candidates selected and trained in the physics analysis described, and what is the classifier output?", "answer": "In the described physics analysis, lepton candidates are selected based on their momentum in the center-of-mass (c.m.) frame, with 1.0 < p[\\mu] < 2.6 GeV/c for muons and 0.8 < p[e] < 2.6 GeV/c for electrons. These ranges are chosen to enhance the contribution of leptons from semileptonic B decays. The leptons are required to be well identified, with a likelihood ratio above 0.9, and this requirement has an efficiency of 90% for muons and 87% for electrons, with a misidentification probability for hadrons of around 5%. The training of the classifier is performed using a simulated Υ(4S) sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb[-1]. The training is done separately for each final-state particle species and for each decay of unstable particles. The classifier output is the probability that a given candidate is a signal, and the training also uses the signal probabilities of all direct decay-products. The training is done in stages, starting with final state particles and K0S, then adding π0 and J/ψ, followed by D mesons, D*, and finally B mesons.

{"question": "How do the authors of 'The Belle II Collaboration' test lepton universality in semileptonic B0-meson decays to charged spin-1 charmed mesons using angular-asymmetry observables?", "answer": "The authors of 'The Belle II Collaboration' present a comprehensive test of lepton universality in semileptonic B0-meson decays to charged spin-1 charmed mesons by measuring five angular-asymmetry observables as functions of the decay recoil. These observables, AFB, S3, S5, S7, and S9, are constructed as one-dimensional integrals of the four-dimensional standard-model differential rate, which is represented in terms of eight helicity amplitudes and as a function of w, cos θℓ, cos θV, and χ. The asymmetries are then calculated as the difference between the signal yields N+x with x ∈ [0, 1] and N−x with x ∈ [−1, 0) after accounting for experimental effects. The differences between the angular asymmetries of electrons and muons, ∆Ax(w), are used to test lepton universality.

{"question": "How are asymmetries and their differences measured in electron-positron collisions at the Belle II experiment, and what is their significance in testing Lepton Universality (LU) and probing non-standard-model interactions?", "answer": "At the Belle II experiment, asymmetries and their differences are measured using a dataset corresponding to 189 fb−1 of electron-positron collisions at 10.58 GeV center-of-mass energy, collected between 2019 and . Of the five asymmetries (AFB, S3, S5, S7, and S9), only AFB and S3 have been measured, but not differentially in w. In the standard model or any extension, S9 is always zero, and S7 has reduced sensitivity to its extensions. However, AFB, S3, and S5 are highly sensitive to LU via their asymmetry differences, which should show highly correlated deviations from the SM expectations in the case of new interactions. Therefore, correlated LUV signatures between the asymmetry differences can help probe the nature of any new interactions. The asymmetries and their differences are measured integrated over three w ranges: the full phase-space (wincl.), the low w region (wlow) from 1 up to 1.275, and the high w region (whigh) from 1.275 to the kinematic endpoint at 1.503. For each asymmetry Ax and w range, signal candidates are separated into angular categories + and − based on the measured value of x. The numbers of signal events N±x are determined with fits to distributions of M2miss, the squared difference between the sum of the four-momenta of the colliding particles and the sum of the four-momenta of the reconstructed particles. These event numbers are then corrected for detector efficiency, acceptance, and resolution effects determined from simulation to calculate unbiased asymmetries. The simultaneous determination of all asymmetries in different w ranges provides a powerful test of LU and probes the nature of non-standard-model interactions.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-017", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are B0 decays, such as Υ (4S) →B0B0, reconstructed in the Belle II detector and what requirements are placed on the reconstructed tag B0 candidates?", "answer": "In the Belle II detector, Υ (4S) →B0B0 decays are reconstructed using the full event interpretation (FEI) algorithm, which reconstructs tag B0 candidates in explicit hadronic decay cascades with no missing particles. Each tag B0 candidate consists of a collection of detected tracks and neutral energy depositions (clusters) and a hypothesis for the full B0 decay cascade that produced them. To select correctly and completely reconstructed B0 candidates, three requirements are placed on the tag B0 candidates: the beam-constrained mass Mbc must be greater than 5.27 GeV, the energy difference ∆E must be in the range [-0.15, 0.1] GeV, and the tag-reconstruction confidence score PFEI must be greater than 0.001. If multiple tag B0 candidates in an event pass these selections, only the one with the highest value of PFEI is kept. The beam-constrained mass is calculated from the center-of-mass collision energy √s and tag-B momentum ⃗pB using the formula Mbc = q(√s/2 − |⃗pB|²), where q is the charge of the B0 meson. The energy difference ∆E is the difference between the center-of-mass collision energy and tag-B energy EB. The tag-reconstruction confidence score PFEI quantifies the agreement between the kinematic properties of the detected particles and the hypothesized decay cascade, with values between zero and one. Correctly and completely reconstructed B0 candidates have Mbc near the B0 mass, ∆E near zero, and PFEI near 1.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-017", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How are the signal yields for each combination of lepton flavor, w interval, and angular category obtained in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, the signal yield for each combination of lepton flavor, w interval, and angular category (+ or −) is obtained using a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the distribution of M2miss. The signal and background shapes are determined using simulation, and a coarse binning is chosen to minimize dependence on resolution modeling. The fitted yields N±x(w) are then corrected for selection and detector acceptance losses using efficiency estimates from simulation. The efficiency ratios between the + and − categories are typically near 1.0 but can range up to nearly 1.4 for AFB, due to the reduced momentum of leptons in the −category.

The term 'FB incl. -, +' seems to be related to the forward-backward asymmetry, which is a quantity that describes the difference in the number of particles scattered in the forward and backward directions.

{"question": "How are kaons and pions identified in the Belle and Belle II experiments, and what are the reconstruction criteria for K0S candidates?", "answer": "In the Belle and Belle II experiments, kaons and pions are identified using the ratio L(K/π) ≡L(K)/[L(K) + L(π)], where L(h) is the likelihood for a kaon or pion to produce the signals observed in the detectors. If L(K/π) > 0.6, the charged particle is identified as a kaon, and if L(K/π) < 0.6, it is identified as a pion. To mitigate pion misidentification in the Belle II data, tracks with a polar angle θ > 120° are removed, as no PID detector covers this region. For K0S candidates, they are reconstructed in their π+π− final state by forming pairs of oppositely charged particles (assumed to be pions) with a common vertex and mass in the range [486, 509] MeV/c2 for Belle data and [491, 504] MeV/c2 for Belle II data, which correspond to 3σ in resolution in either direction from the known K0 mass.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-018", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}

The BDT classifier output, C, is required to be greater than 0.15, which retains 95% of signal in Belle data and 97% in Belle II data, while rejecting 60% and 63% of background, respectively. To suppress D decays from D∗→Dπ arising from e+e−→cc →D∗D(∗)X processes, the observed difference between the mass of the D candidate and the mass of the D∗candidates reconstructed by associating any π± or π0 in the ROE is required to be outside ±3σ in resolution from the known D∗-D mass difference.

{"question": "Can you explain the different PDFs used in the fit models for identifying kaons and pions in Belle and Belle II data, and how they are related to the physical observables?", "answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain! In the analysis of Belle and Belle II data to identify kaons and pions, several PDFs (probability density functions) are used in the fit models. The choice of PDFs and their parameters vary for different components of the decay modes and data subsets.\n\nFor signal, the ∆E PDF is the sum of two Gaussian functions and an asymmetric Gaussian function. The cross-feed ∆E PDF is similar, but with its own set of parameters. The BB background component has different ∆E PDFs for CP modes and flavor-specific modes, and a straight line is used for the C′ PDF with a slope fixed from simulated data. A peaking background is estimated from the D mass sidebands in data and its PDF shape is fixed from a simulated sample.\n\nFor the continuum component, the ∆E PDF is a straight line and the C′ PDF is the sum of two exponential functions. A simultaneous fit is performed to all decay modes in both the Belle and Belle II data to determine the six charge asymmetries and three branching-fraction ratios.\n\nThe yields of B± →Dh± with the D decaying to the state X and the charged hadron identified as h′± are related to these physical observables through equations (4.1)-(4.4), where A is the charge asymmetry, N is the total number of events, ε± is the efficiency to identify a kaon with ±1 charge, and κ± is the rate for misidentifying a pion as a kaon with ±1 charge.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-018", "page": 8, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How are events selected and simulated in the Belle and Belle II experiments for studying D meson decays?", "answer": "In the Belle and Belle II experiments, events are selected using a two-step process. First, all events are required to pass the online selection criteria based on total energy deposition or the number of charged-particle tracks. The efficiency of the online selection is found to be close to 100%. For offline analysis, charged hadrons (K± and π±) are selected based on their distance of closest approach to the interaction point and particle identification (PID) likelihoods. A kaon is identified if L(K/π) > 0.6, and a pion candidate from D decay is required to satisfy L(K/π) < 0.6. In Belle II data, the polar angle of the prompt h± is also restricted to be within the acceptance of the PID detectors. The kaon-identification efficiency is in the range of 86%–90%, and the rate to misidentify a pion as a kaon is in the range of 3%--9%. K0S mesons are reconstructed via their decays to π+π−, and combinatorial background is rejected based on the output of a neural network (Belle) or a boosted decision tree (Belle II). Simulated samples are used to identify sources of background, optimize selection criteria, calculate selection efficiencies, and distinguish fit models. Events are generated using EvtGen, Pythia, KKMC, and Photos for particle decays and Geant3 (Belle) and Geant4 (Belle II) for detector response. Beam backgrounds are taken into account by overlaying random trigger data (Belle) and simulating the Touschek effect, beam-gas scattering, and luminosity-dependent backgrounds (Belle II).", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-019", "page": 6, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are B± candidates selected and backgrounds suppressed in the context of the π± tracks and vertex detector associated with K0S in e+e− collisions?", "answer": "B± candidates are selected and backgrounds are suppressed in several ways in the context of the π± tracks and vertex detector associated with K0S in e+e− collisions. First, neutral D candidates, reconstructed from K0S, K±, and π∓ candidates, must have a mass in the range of [1.85, 1.88] GeV/c2. The beam-constrained mass, Mbc, must exceed 5.27 GeV/c2, and |∆E| must be less than 0.15 GeV. These requirements suppress continuum background. To further suppress continuum background, modified Fox-Wolfram moments, thrust of the B decay products, the angle between the axis of this thrust and that of the particles in the rest of the event, the polar angle of the B momentum, the distance between the B decay vertex and that of the ROE in the longitudinal direction, and the output of a B-flavour-tagging algorithm are used. These variables have correlations of 4% or smaller with ∆E. BDT classifiers are trained with these variables separately for Belle and Belle II, and the classifier output, C, is required to be greater than 0.3. This rejects a large fraction of continuum background candidates and retains a high fraction of signal candidates. B± candidates in which the D comes from a D∗± decay are suppressed by reconstructing possible D∗± candidates from the D and a charged particle from the ROE and vetoing any B± candidate whose D forms a D∗± with mass difference in the range of [143, 148] MeV/c2. Remaining background candidates come from continuum events, cross-feed background from signal events in which the prompt K± is misidentified as a π± or the reverse, or from other B decays such as B± →D∗h± or B± →DK∗±.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-019", "page": 7, "chunk_type": "text"}

The given data point is L = 362 ffb at t = -1. However, without a functional relationship between L and t, it is not possible to calculate the derivative directly. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific value for dL/dt. \n\nInstead, let's use the graphical data to estimate the rate of change of luminosity with respect to time. The graph provided spans from t = -0.1 to t = 0.1 with data points at t = -0.1, t = -0.05, and t = 0. From the graph, we can see that the luminosity increases as time increases. Therefore, the slope of the line will be positive, indicating a positive rate of change. \n\nTo estimate the slope of the line, we can use the two data points at t = -0.1 and t = 0. The change in luminosity (ΔL) between these two points is 362 ffb - 0 ffb = 362 ffb. The change in time (Δt) is 0.1 s - (-0.1) s = 0.2 s. Therefore, the slope of the line, which is the rate of change of luminosity with respect to time (dL/dt), is given by: \n\n$$\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{362 ffb}{0.2 s} = 1810 ffbs^{-1}$$ \n\nThis is only an estimate, as we are using two data points to approximate the derivative.

{"question": "How does the equation relating luminosity distance (L), lookback time (t), and the Hubble constant (H) relate to the measurement of distance in cosmology?", "answer": "In cosmology, the luminosity distance (L) is often used to measure large distances, such as those to distant galaxies or quasars. The relationship between the luminosity distance, lookback time (t), and the Hubble constant (H) is given by the equation L = 362*t, where L is in femto-parsecs (fb) and t is in billions of years (Gyr). This equation is derived from the Friedmann equation, which governs the expansion of the universe. The Hubble constant is a measure of the current expansion rate of the universe. By measuring the luminosity distance to an object and knowing the Hubble constant, one can determine the lookback time, or the amount of time it has taken for the light from that object to reach us. This is useful for studying the history and evolution of the universe. The plot shows the fit of this equation to some example data, with the total fit (in red) and the background (in blue) shown separately.

{"question": "What is the relationship between the luminosity L, the cross section σ, and the number of observed events N in the context of the Belle II experiment, and how does the efficiency C' affect these quantities?", "answer": "In particle physics experiments like Belle II, the number of observed events N for a given process can be related to the luminosity L (which measures the rate of particle collisions) and the cross section σ (which measures the probability of the process occurring) through the formula N = L × σ. The luminosity is typically measured in units of inverse femtobarns (fb^-1), while the cross section is measured in units of femtobarns (fb). The relationship between these quantities can be used to predict the number of events that should be observed for a given process, given the luminosity of the experiment and the cross section of the process. The efficiency C' is a measure of how well the detector is able to detect and record the events that occur. It can affect the number of observed events by modifying the relationship to N = L × σ × C'. For example, if the efficiency is 0.5, then only half of the events that occur will be observed. This can be important to consider when analyzing the results of a particle physics experiment, as the efficiency of the detector can affect the number of observed events and thus the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-019", "page": 17, "chunk_type": "text"}

They repeat the fit for each variation and inspect the distributions of results. If they are approximately Gaussian, they take the standard deviations as systematic uncertainties. If they are non-Gaussian, they conservatively take the full ranges of the distributions as the systematic uncertainties. For the ∆E shape of the continuum component, they repeat the fit using a second-order polynomial function as an alternative model and take the changes of the fit results as systematic uncertainties. They also consider the difference in efficiencies for detecting and reconstructing D →K0 SK−π+ and D →K0 SK+π− decays, and assign the differences in the results as systematic uncertainties. They repeat the analysis using the ratio of the former to the latter, which is 0.98 in simulation, and assign the differences in the results as systematic uncertainties.

In a table like the one you mentioned, the entries might represent the correlation coefficients between different measurement categories. \n\nFor example, if the table has entries for 'Belle K*±' and 'Belle II K*±', these entries might represent the correlation coefficient between the K*± measurements made by the Belle and Belle II experiments. A correlation coefficient of 1 would indicate a perfect positive correlation (i.e., the measurements are identical), while a coefficient of -1 would indicate a perfect negative correlation (i.e., the measurements are exactly opposite). A coefficient of 0 would indicate no correlation.\n\nIt's important to note that systematic correlations can have a significant impact on the interpretation of experimental results, particularly when combining or comparing results from different experiments. Therefore, it's essential to account for these correlations in any statistical analysis.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have a specific table or set of results you'd like me to interpret, please provide it and I'll do my best to assist you.\"\n}", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-019", "page": 21, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "Can you describe the layout of the Belle II detector and the role of its subdetectors in reconstructing charged-particle trajectories?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is arranged in a cylindrical structure around the e+e−interaction point. It consists of several subdetectors, including a two-layer silicon-pixel detector, a four-layer double-sided silicon-strip detector, and a central drift chamber (CDC). The role of these subdetectors in reconstructing charged-particle trajectories (tracks) is as follows: \n\n1. The two-layer silicon-pixel detector is the innermost subdetector, responsible for reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles in the immediate vicinity of the interaction point. Its primary function is to provide high-precision spatial measurements of charged particles, enabling the determination of their initial trajectories.\n\n2. Following the pixel detector, there is a four-layer double-sided silicon-strip detector. This subdetector continues the task of tracking charged particles, providing additional spatial measurements to improve the precision of the reconstructed trajectories.\n\n3. The central drift chamber (CDC) is the outermost subdetector involved in track reconstruction. It is a gaseous detector that measures the trajectories of charged particles using the principle of ionization drift. The CDC's large volume and high number of measurement layers allow for precise tracking of charged particles over a wide range of angles.\n\nIn summary, the Belle II detector's subdetectors work together to reconstruct charged-particle trajectories, starting with the high-precision measurements of the silicon-pixel detector and continuing through the silicon-strip detector and central drift chamber. This coordinated approach enables the Belle II detector to achieve accurate and efficient tracking of charged particles in high-energy physics experiments.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-021", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How are τ-pair candidates selected in e+e− center-of-mass frame experiments, and what are the criteria for signal and tag hemispheres?", "answer": "In e+e− center-of-mass frame experiments, τ-pair candidates are selected by requiring the event to contain exactly four charged particles with zero total charge. Each charged particle should have a trajectory displaced from the average interaction point by less than 3 cm along the z-axis and less than 1 cm in the transverse plane. The momenta of charged particles are scaled with correction factors to account for imperfections in the magnetic-field description, misalignment of the detector, and material modeling. Neutral pions are identified as photon pairs with masses between 115 MeV/c2 and 152 MeV/c2. Photon-energy thresholds are applied to suppress beam-induced backgrounds. The signal hemisphere is defined as that containing three charged particles assumed to originate from the τ −→π−π+π−ντ decay. The tag hemisphere contains only one charged particle and up to one neutral pion, which can be from leptonic or hadronic τ decays. The thrust axis, the unit vector that maximizes the thrust value, is used to approximate the boundary between the hemispheres.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-021", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How is the computation of Mmin determined in the context of e+e− collider experiments, and how is the collision energy √s obtained from the measured B-meson energy E∗B?", "answer": "In the computation of Mmin, the center-of-mass energy of e+e− collisions is utilized, particularly when the collision energy is slightly above the kinematic-production threshold for B ¯B pairs. The B-meson energy, E∗B, is measured using fully reconstructed neutral and charged B-meson decays. The relationship between E∗B, the momentum (p∗B), and the mass (mB) of the B meson is given by the equation E∗B = mB + 12mB(p∗B)2. A maximum-likelihood fit is performed on the E∗B distribution to determine its peak position. \n\nThe collision energy √s is obtained from E∗B after correcting for the impact of Initial State Radiation (ISR) and considering the energy dependence of the e+e−→B ¯B cross-section. This is done using a Gaussian model with a width of σ√s around a mean value √s, where both √s and σ√s vary slowly. The collision energy is then corrected chronologically ordered events, as shown in the figure with the caption 'Preliminary Belle II result for the center-of-mass energy distribution of e+e− collisions and the corrected distribution considering ISR effects.

The fluctuations in √s and 2E∗B are due to various factors affecting the collisions in the particle accelerator.

The charged-particle momentum correction is a crucial step in this process. It aims to account for the energy loss that charged particles undergo as they pass through matter. This energy loss can cause the measured momentum of the particle to be lower than its true momentum, leading to inaccurate results.

{"question": "How is the systematic uncertainty determined for the simulation imperfections in the measurement of the fit-bias correction in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, the systematic uncertainty due to simulation imperfections is determined by studying possible mismodelings in the simulation that could lead to an incorrect estimation of the fit-bias correction. One such source of uncertainty is the difference in material properties between the simulation and the actual detector. For instance, studies have shown a deficit of around 10% in the density of the beam-pipe in the simulation. To estimate the impact of this deficit, the beam-pipe density in the simulation is increased by 10% for a signal sample corresponding to 4 ab−1. The statistical uncertainty of the difference between the results using the nominal simulation and the simulation with the modified material density is 0.03 MeV/c2, which is significantly larger than the actual difference between the two models.

The data is divided into sub-regions of various kinematic variables and consistent results are obtained, indicating no significant unaccounted-for systematic effects.

{"question": "How are CP asymmetries determined in the measurement of B0 → K0π0 decays?", "answer": "In the measurement of B0 → K0π0 decays, CP asymmetries are determined by calculating charge-dependent signal-yield asymmetries for the flavor-specific decay modes. The production flavor of the signal B meson is inferred using information from other charged particles in the event. This is accomplished through the use of algorithms and simulated events to study the sample composition, determine signal efficiencies, and develop the fit model. Any differences between data and simulation are corrected using several control channels, such as B+ → D0(→ K+π−)π+ decays. All analysis choices and procedures are developed and finalized using simulated and control-sample data before examining the signal data sample.

{"question": "Can you describe the main components and functionality of the Belle II detector?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is a particle physics detector that consists of several subsystems arranged cylindrically around the interaction region. It uses cylindrical coordinates, with the z-axis being approximately collinear with the electron beam. The detector is designed to reconstruct charged-particle trajectories (tracks) using a two-layer silicon-pixel detector (PXD), surrounded by a four-layer double-sided silicon-strip detector and a central 56-layer drift chamber. These detectors also measure the ionization energy loss of the particles. A quartz-based Cherenkov counter identifies charged hadrons in the central region, and an aerogel-based ring-imaging Cherenkov counter identifies charged hadrons in the forward region. An electromagnetic calorimeter made of CsI(Tl) crystals measures photon and electron energies and directions. These subdetectors are immersed in a 1.5 T axial magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid. A subdetector dedicated to identifying muons and K0L mesons is installed outside of the solenoid. Large samples of simulated data are produced using software packages like KKMC, PYTHIA8, EVTGEN, PHOTOS, and GEANT4 to model the physics processes and detector response. The simulation includes overlays of beam-induced backgrounds that correspond to the conditions of the data used.

{"question": "Can you describe the composition and functionality of the Belle II detector used for data analyzed in 2019-2022?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is composed of several sub-detectors designed to measure different properties of particles. Starting from the innermost layer, the PXD layer (with one third of the total layers installed for the data analyzed here) and one sixth of the outermost layer are used for tracking and vertexing. The symmetry axis of these detectors, defined as the z axis, is almost coincident with the direction of the electron beam. Surrounding the central drift chamber (CDC), which also provides dE/dx energy-loss measurements, is a time-of-propagation counter in the central region and an aerogel-based ring-imaging Cherenkov counter in the forward region. These detectors provide charged-particle identification. Following this is an electromagnetic calorimeter based on CsI(Tl) crystals that primarily provides energy and timing measurements for photons and electrons. Outside of the calorimeter is a superconducting solenoid magnet that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field parallel to the z axis. Its flux return is instrumented with resistive-plate chambers and plastic-scintillator modules to detect muons, K0L mesons, and neutrons. Data collected at the Υ(4S) resonance in 2019-2022, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of (362±2) fb−1 and containing (387±6)×106 BB pairs, were used in the analysis. Simulated samples were used to train multivariate classifiers and define fit models.

{"question": "How are the yields for TD, TI, and control channel events extracted in the three-dimensional likelihood fit?", "answer": "The yields for TD, TI, and control channel events are extracted using a three-dimensional likelihood fit to the un-binned distributions of Mbc, M(K0SK0SK), and O'CS. The likelihood function includes two sample components, signal and background. The signal component shape is determined from fits to distributions of simulated signal and control samples. The Mbc distribution is modeled with a Gaussian function for the signal TD and control samples and with a Crystal Ball shape for the signal TI sample. The M(K0SK0SK) distribution is modeled with the sum of a Gaussian function and an asymmetric Breit-Wigner function for both signal and control samples. The O'CS distribution is modeled with the sum of a symmetric and an asymmetric Gaussian function. The background is modeled with an ARGUS function for the Mbc distribution, a linear function for the M(K0SK0SK) distribution, and the sum of a symmetric and an asymmetric Gaussian function for the O'CS distribution. The fit simultaneously determines the yield of each sample and 14 background shape parameters. The signal region is defined as 5.272 < Mbc < 5.288 GeV/c2, 5.2 < M(K0SK0SK) < 5.36 GeV/c2, and -4.44 < O'CS < 8.85. The low-mass tails of the M(K0SK0SK) distribution of the signal TI component are mainly due to π →µνµ decays, which occur in 3% of the reconstructed signal B0 →K0SK0SK0S events and are mostly classified as TI events due to the poor vertex fit quality.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-023", "page": 4, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties determined in the measurement of CP asymmetries in B meson decays?", "answer": "The systematic uncertainties in the measurement of CP asymmetries in B meson decays are determined using various methods. The systematic uncertainty in the resolution function is determined by analyzing simulated samples with alternative resolution models, whose dependence on the vertex-fit quality is partly or entirely removed. The simulation assumes S = −0.7 and C = 0. The systematic uncertainty due to flavor tagging includes the bias due to the flavor asymmetry in the tagging efficiency between B0 and B0. This is determined by generating two sets of simplified simulated experiments, with and without the asymmetry, and fitting for S and C in both ignoring the asymmetry. The difference between the mean values of S and C obtained in the two sets is the uncertainty. The correlations between M(K0SK0SK) and vertex-fit quality for BCP (-0.06 for TD events), and between O'CS and r (0.15) are evaluated using simplified simulated samples generated with and without these effects. The CP asymmetries are affected by the interference between a CKM-favored transition b →cud and a doubly CKM-suppressed transition b →ucd on the tag side. A systematic uncertainty is assigned to the effect of the tag-side interference assuming the world average values S = −0.83 and C = −0.15. The systematic uncertainty due to the vertex reconstruction is determined by varying the parameters describing the IP profile and boost vector, the track requirements used in the Btag vertex reconstruction, and the criteria to select TD events, and repeating the fit on data. The effect from possible misalignment of the vertex detector is evaluated by using four simulated samples, each assuming a different misalignment configuration and CP asymmetries of S = −1.0 and C = 0.

Adachi and many other authors in the Belle II Preprint 2023-014 and KEK Preprint 2023-28, presents a study on the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element |Vcb|. This is achieved by analyzing B0 → D∗+ ℓ− νℓ decays, where ℓ stands for an electron or a muon, with the Belle II detector. The CKM matrix elements are crucial for understanding the weak interactions between quarks and play a significant role in the study of CP violation. The Belle II experiment, located at the SuperKEKB collider in Japan, is an upgrade of the Belle experiment and aims to perform high-precision measurements in the flavor sector. The analysis presented in this paper is based on the early dataset collected by the Belle II experiment, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 44.5 fb−1.

{"question": "How was the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix-element magnitude |Vcb| determined using B0 → D∗+ℓ−¯νℓ decays in collision data collected by the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "The Belle II Collaboration determined the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix-element magnitude |Vcb| using B0 → D∗+ℓ−¯νℓ decays, where ℓ represents an electron or muon. This analysis was conducted using 189 fb−1 of collision data collected by the Belle II experiment, located at the SuperKEKB e+e−collider. \n\nPartial decay rates were reported as functions of the recoil parameter w and three decay angles separately for electron and muon final states. The value of |Vcb| was then obtained using the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed and Caprini-Lellouch-Neubert parametrizations. The results for the two parametrizations are |Vcb|BGL = (40.57±0.31±0.95±0.58)×10−3 and |Vcb|CLN = (40.13±0.27±0.93±0.58)×10−3, with the uncertainties representing statistical components, systematic components, and components from the lattice QCD input, respectively. \n\nAdditionally, the branching fraction was measured to be B(B0 →D∗+ℓ−¯νℓ) = (4.922 ± 0.023 ± 0.220)%, and the ratio of branching fractions for electron and muon final states was found to be 0.998 ± 0.009 ± 0.020.

{"question": "According to the Standard Model of particle physics, what is the significance of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and the determination of the magnitude of the CKM matrix element Vcb?", "answer": "The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is a 3 × 3 unitary complex matrix in the Standard Model that relates the weak interaction and mass eigenstates of quarks. It is currently the only established source for charge-parity (CP) violating processes in the Standard Model. The elements of the CKM matrix are free parameters that need to be determined experimentally. In this context, the determination of the magnitude of the CKM matrix element Vcb is significant because it should be consistent when determined using different physics processes involving b → c quark transitions. However, a longstanding discrepancy has been observed between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |Vcb|. The most precise inclusive determination combines measured spectral moments with calculations at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong interaction, resulting in |Vcb| = (42.16 ± 0.51) × 10−3 (inclusive). On the other hand, the most precise exclusive determination combines measurements of exclusive B → D(∗)ℓ¯νℓ and B0s → D(∗)−sℓ+νℓ decays, yielding |Vcb| = (39.10 ± 0.50) × 10−3 (exclusive).

These form factors parametrize the nonperturbative physics of the B → D∗ transition as functions of the recoil parameter w = v · v′, where v and v′ are the four-velocities of the B and D∗ mesons, respectively. In the light lepton mass limit, the decay is described by hA1 and two form-factor ratios, R1 = hV/hA1 and R2 = hA3 + r∗hA2/hA1, with r∗ = mD∗/mB. An alternative parametrization is given by the helicity basis, with form factors g, f, and F1. The decay rate is fully parametrized by the recoil parameter w and three decay angles: θℓ (the angle between the charged lepton and the direction opposite to the B meson in the virtual W boson rest frame), θV (the angle between the direction of the D meson and the direction opposite to the B meson in the D∗ meson rest frame), and χ (the azimuthal angle between the two decay planes spanned by the W boson and D∗ meson decay products, defined in the rest frame of the B meson).

The Caprini-Lellouch-Neubert (CLN) parametrization, as described in Reference [25], also uses dispersive bounds but reduces the number of parameters by incorporating quark-model input. The form-factor hA1 is expanded in z with a single slope parameter ρ2, while the remaining form factors are parametrized using ratios R1(w) and R2(w).

The Belle II detector is composed of several nested subsystems arranged around the beam pipe in a cylindrical geometry. The innermost subsystem is the vertex detector, which includes two layers of silicon pixel detectors and four outer layers of silicon strip detectors. Most of the tracking volume consists of a helium and ethane-based small cell drift chamber (CDC), which covers a polar angle range of 17° to 150° and the full ϕ range. Outside the drift chamber, a time-of-propagation detector provides charged-particle identification in the barrel region, while a proximity-focusing, ring-imaging Cherenkov detector with an aerogel radiator (ARICH) is used in the forward end cap. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) is made of CsI(Tl) crystals, and an axial magnetic field is provided by a superconducting solenoid situated outside the calorimeter. Multiple layers of scintillators and resistive-plate chambers, located between the magnetic flux-return iron plates, constitute the KL and muon identification system (KLM).

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties in the background subtraction and unfolding procedure accounted for in the measurement of partial decay rates?", "answer": " In the measurement of partial decay rates, several systematic uncertainties are taken into account, including those from background subtraction and unfolding procedure efficiency corrections. The background subtraction uncertainties stem from the signal and background template shapes in cos θBY and ∆M. To validate the modeling, a sample of same-sign D∗+ℓ+ events is reconstructed, which are free of the signal decay. Correction factors are derived for both background templates based on D∗+ℓ+ events, and the resulting correction factors are in the range [0.85, 1.15]. The full difference between applying and not applying this correction is taken as the systematic uncertainty from background modeling. The systematic uncertainties from the correction factors are treated as uncorrelated. The impact of varying the assumed B →D∗∗ℓ¯νℓ background composition is also studied and is found to be negligible. The statistical and systematic correlation matrices are given in Appendix C. For the unfolding procedure and efficiency corrections, the statistical uncertainty from the limited size of the simulated sample is propagated into the signal and background shapes, migration matrices, and signal efficiencies. The uncertainties associated with the finite size of simulated samples are uncorrelated. Lepton identification uncertainties are determined by producing 400 replicas of the bin-wise correction factors, fluctuating each factor within its uncorrelated statistical uncertainty and its correlated systematic uncertainty.

Similarly, if the Simulated sample size entry for the same bin is 1.2%, this means that the uncertainty due to the simulated sample size is 1.2%.\\n\\nIt's important to note that these uncertainties are usually independent, so they can be added in quadrature to get the total uncertainty for each bin.\\n\\nFor instance, if the statistical uncertainty is 2.5%, the uncertainty due to the simulated sample size is 1.2%, the signal modeling uncertainty is 0.9%, the background subtraction uncertainty is 0.7%, the lepton ID efficiency uncertainty is 0.5%, the slow-pion efficiency uncertainty is 0.4%, and the tracking of K, π, ℓ uncertainty is 0.3%, then the total uncertainty for that bin would be calculated as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\sqrt{2.5^2 + 1.2^2 + 0.9^2 + 0.7^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.4^2 + 0.3^2} = 3.38%$$\\", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-024", "page": 24, "chunk_type": "text"}

The parameters were determined by fitting the proper decay-time distribution of a sample of 415 signal events, with A = −0.04+0.14 −0.15 ± 0.05 and S = 0.75+0.20 −0.23 ±0.04. Here, A represents the asymmetry in the rates of CP-conjugate decays, while S quantifies the interference between a B0 decay amplitude and that of a B0 following B0–B0 mixing.

The analysis is developed and tested with simulation and validated with a control sample of B0 →J/ψK0S decays before examining the B0 →K0Sπ0 candidates in the data. The Belle II detector operates at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy (4 GeV e+ on 7 GeV e−) collider and consists of several subdetectors surrounding the interaction region in a cylindrical geometry. The subdetectors most relevant for this study are a silicon-based vertex detector (VXD), a gas-based central drift chamber (CDC), and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) made of CsI(Tl) crystals. The VXD is the innermost component, which samples the trajectories of charged particles ('tracks') near the interaction region to determine the decay positions of their parent particles.

{"question": "What is the measurement of time-dependent rate asymmetries in B0 →ϕK0S decays by the Belle II Collaboration and what are the observed direct and mixing-induced CP asymmetries?", "answer": "The Belle II Collaboration has presented a measurement of time-dependent rate asymmetries in B0 →ϕK0S decays using a data sample collected at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy e+e−collider in 2019-2022. This sample contains (387 ± 6) × 106 bottom-antibottom mesons from Υ(4S) resonance decays. The analysis resulted in the reconstruction of 162 ± 17 signal events. The charge-parity (CP) violating parameters were extracted from a fit to the distribution of the proper-decay-time difference of the two B mesons. The measured direct and mixing-induced CP asymmetries are C = −0.31 ± 0.20 ± 0.05 and S = 0.54 ± 0.26+0.06 −0.08, respectively.

{"question": "How are CP asymmetries measured in loop-suppressed B meson decays, such as B0 → ϕK0S, and what is the role of interfering non-SM amplitudes in these measurements?", "answer": "Measurements of CP asymmetries in loop-suppressed B meson decays, like B0 → ϕK0S, are sensitive probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Gluonic-penguin b → qqs modes, such as B0 → ϕK0S, are particularly sensitive to interfering non-SM amplitudes that carry additional weak-interaction phases. The SM reference for these measurements is the mixing-induced CP asymmetry S ≡ sin 2ϕ1 observed in tree-level b → ccs transitions, where ϕ1 (or β) equals arg(−VcdV*cb/VtdV*tb) and Vij are Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix elements. The deviation from the value of S observed in b → ccs transitions is the key observable. In the context of B0 → ϕK0S decays, such a deviation is expected to be at most 0.02 ± 0.01 within the SM, while the direct CP asymmetry C is expected to be zero. However, the current world-average values for B0 → ϕK0S are S = 0.74±0.11 and C = 0.01 ± 0.14, which suggests that experimental knowledge must be improved. To measure S and C in the sample of electron-positron collisions collected by the Belle II experiment in 2019–2022, researchers use the probability function given by equation (1) in the content, which includes the B0 lifetime (τB0), B0 −B0 mixing frequency (∆md), and the flavor of the BCP and Btag mesons. The extraction of CP asymmetries involves modeling the distributions of signal BCP and backgrounds in ∆t and other discriminating variables, followed by a likelihood fit.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-026", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "Can you describe the components and functionality of the Belle II detector used in the study of charged-particle trajectories and decay-vertex positions?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is a complex system used to study the behavior of particles in high-energy collisions. The outer PXD layer, which is only one-sixth installed for the data used in this work, determines the momenta and electric charges of charged particles along with a 56-layer central drift-chamber (CDC). Charged-hadron identification (PID) is provided by a time-of-propagation counter and an aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov counter, located in the central and forward regions outside the CDC, respectively. The CDC also provides additional PID information through the measurement of specific ionization. Photons are identified, and electrons are reconstructed by an electromagnetic calorimeter made of CsI(Tl) crystals, covering the region outside of the PID detectors. The tracking and PID subsystems, and the calorimeter, are surrounded by a superconducting solenoid, providing an axial magnetic field of 1.5 T. The central axis of the solenoid defines the z axis of the laboratory frame, pointing approximately in the direction of the electron beam. Outside of the magnet lies the muon and K0L identification system, which consists of iron plates interspersed with resistive-plate chambers and plastic scintillators. Simulated events are used to model signal and background distributions, study the detector response, and test the analysis. Quark-antiquark pairs from e+e− collisions and hadron decays are simulated using KKMC, Pythia8, and EvtGen, while the detector response and K0S decays are simulated using Geant4.

{"question": "How are B0 → ϕK0S decays selected and reconstructed in an experiment, and how is the proper-time difference between the B0 and KS0 decays estimated?", "answer": "B0 → ϕK0S decays are selected online by a trigger based on track multiplicity and total energy deposited in the calorimeter. The decays are then reconstructed using ϕ → K+K- and K0S → π+π- decays, with tracks required to have a polar angle θ within the CDC acceptance (17° < θ < 150°). The ϕ and K0S candidates are formed by combining K+K- and π+π- pairs, respectively, and requiring their invariant mass to be within certain ranges. To suppress combinatorial background, K0S candidates are required to have a displacement of at least 0.05 cm from the ϕ decay vertex. The beam-energy constrained mass Mbc and energy difference ∆E are computed for each B0 → ϕK0S candidate, and candidates satisfying Mbc > 5.2 GeV/c2 and |∆E| < 0.2 GeV are retained for further analysis. The B0 decay vertex is determined using the TreeFitter algorithm, and the proper-time difference is estimated using the longitudinal decay-vertex positions of the B0 and KS0 mesons as ∆t ≈ ℓCP − ℓtag / (βγγ∗c), where βγ = 0.28 and γ∗= 1.002 are Lorentz factors, and the average distance between the B0 and KS0 vertices is approximately 100 µm along the z axis.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-026", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}

The following contributions to the sample composition are considered: signal B0 → ϕK0S events, nonresonant B0 → K+K−K0S background, and continuum background. Additional BB background events are treated as a source of systematic uncertainty. Low-multiplicity events are distributed like continuum in the variables used in the fit and are treated as part of the continuum background. The Mbc, O′CS, cos θH, and ∆t variables are used in the fit. The Mbc and O′CS variables provide discrimination between signal and continuum background, while the helicity angle θH is used to distinguish between signal and nonresonant components. The ∆t variable and tag-flavor q provide access to the time-dependent CP asymmetries. A conditional observable, σ∆t, is used to model the per-event resolution. The total probability density function (PDF) is given by the product of the four one-dimensional PDFs, since the dependences among the fit observables are negligible.

{"question": "How does the novel approach to charm-flavor tagging for the Belle II experiment work, and why is it beneficial for measuring CP asymmetries in neutral D mesons?", "answer": "The novel approach to charm-flavor tagging for the Belle II experiment involves using information from the other charmed hadron produced in the e+e−→cc event, which is referred to as opposite-side tagging. This method complements the same-side tagging, which uses the charge of the low-momentum (soft) pion originating from the decay of a parent D∗+ meson. Opposite-side tagging has been used for b-flavor tagging at both e+e− and hadron colliders but hasn't been applied to charm-flavor tagging before. It relies on the pair production of c and c quarks and infers the flavor of a given neutral D meson (signal D meson) from the identification of the flavor of the other charmed hadron. The flavor of the other charmed hadron is inferred using the charge of its decay products, which are either charged hadrons (π, K, and p) or leptons (e and µ). This approach is beneficial for measuring CP asymmetries in neutral D mesons because it allows for the identification of the charm flavor at production, i.e., whether the neutral D meson is produced as a D0 or a D0bar. This task, known as flavor tagging, is crucial for measuring mixing and CP asymmetries in decays of neutral D mesons. The smaller sample of neutral D mesons available for measurements that require tagging is compensated by the improved tagging efficiency and purity provided by the novel approach.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-027", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How are the tagging efficiency εtag, mistag fraction ω, and effective tagging efficiency εefftag defined in the context of particle physics?", "answer": "In particle physics, the tagging efficiency εtag and mistag fraction ω are standard metrics used for the evaluation of tagging performance. The tagging efficiency εtag is defined as the ratio of correctly tagged candidates (R) to the total number of candidates (R + W + U), where W and U represent the number of wrongly tagged and untagged candidates, respectively. The mistag fraction ω is defined as the ratio of wrongly tagged candidates (W) to the total number of tagged candidates (R + W), with an upper limit of 50% to account for the fact that the tagging decision is reversed when W exceeds R. The effective tagging efficiency, or tagging power, εefftag, is given by the product of εtag and the square of the average dilution factor ⟨r⟩, which accounts for candidates that are mistagged. The dilution factor r has a counterintuitive impact on the performance, with a smaller value having a larger effect than a larger value. A dilution factor of r = 0 indicates that the flavor is not identifiable, while a value of r = 1 indicates that the flavor is perfectly known.

{"question": "How is a histogram-based gradient-boosting decision tree (HBDT) used in the classification algorithm for identifying the signal flavor in D0 mesons, and what are the input variables for the HBDT?", "answer": "In the classification algorithm for identifying the signal flavor in D0 mesons, a histogram-based gradient-boosting decision tree (HBDT) from the scikit-learn library is used. The HBDT is configured with a maximum depth of 10, a maximum number of leaves of 31, a minimum number of samples per leaf of 20, a maximum number of bins of 255, and a learning rate of 0.2. These values optimize performance while avoiding overtraining. The HBDT receives two input variables for every ROE particle: the angle ∆R, which is the square of the difference in azimuthal angles and pseudorapidities between the momentum of the ROE particle and that of the signal D0 meson, and the difference between the pion and kaon identification discriminators, Pπ−PK.

{"question": "How is the performance of the CFT evaluated and the per-candidate dilution calibrated using Belle II data?", "answer": "The performance of the CFT is evaluated using data collected by Belle II from 2019 to 2022 at collision energies near the mass of the Υ(4S) resonance, with an integrated luminosity of 362 fb−1. The tagging performance is studied for neutral D mesons and for D+ and Λ+c decays. This allows for insight into the contributions from various tagging categories and validation of the results observed in simulation during testing and training. The reconstruction of signal candidates starts by selecting events that are inconsistent with Bhabha scattering and have at least three tracks with specific transverse and longitudinal impact parameters. Charged kaon, pion, and proton candidates are required to be in the acceptance of the drift chamber, originate from the e+e−collision, and be identified as kaons, pions, and protons. The per-candidate dilution is calibrated by studying the signal decays of charmed hadrons: D0 →K−π+, D0 →K−π+π+π−, D0 →K−π+π0, D+ →K0Sπ+, D+ →K−π+π+, and Λ+c →pK−π+. The mistag fraction in data is computed by comparing the kaon charge with the CFT decision. To account for wrong-sign decays, the mistag fractions measured in data are corrected by subtracting the ratio of time-integrated wrong-sign to right-sign rates, which are (3.798 ± 0.014) × 10−3 for D0 →K±π∓, (3.33 ± 0.27) × 10−3 for D0 →K±π∓π+π−, and (2.12 ± 0.13) × 10−3 for D0 →K±π±π0 decays.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-027", "page": 9, "chunk_type": "text"}

This deviation suggests that the algorithm is overconfidently assigning the flavor for this class of events.

{"question": "What is the significance of the b →sν¯ν transition in particle physics and how is it related to the B+ →K+ν¯ν decay?", "answer": "The b →sν¯ν transition is a flavor-changing neutral-current process that is suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism. This transition can only occur at higher orders in SM perturbation theory through weak-interaction amplitudes involving the exchange of at least two gauge bosons. The B+ →K+ν¯ν decay is a rare decay process in which a B+ meson decays into a K+ meson and a pair of neutrinos. This decay is dominated by the b →sν¯ν transition in the SM, and its SM branching fraction is predicted to be (5.58 ± 0.37) × 10−6. The B+ →K+ν¯ν decay rate can be significantly modified in models that predict non-SM particles, such as leptoquarks, or in models where the B+ meson decays into a kaon and an undetectable particle, such as an axion or a dark-sector mediator. The study of the B+ →K+ν¯ν decay is experimentally challenging due to the unconstrained kinematics and the presence of two neutrinos in the final state. In this study, the signal B meson is produced in the e+e−→Υ(4S) →B+B−process, and an inclusive tagging analysis method is used to mitigate the limitations due to the unconstrained kinematics.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-028", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How does the analysis method for measuring the branching fraction of the B+ →K+ν¯ν decay in the ITA and HTA analyses proceed?", "answer": "The analysis method for measuring the branching fraction of the B+ →K+ν¯ν decay in both the ITA and HTA analyses involves several steps. Initially, there is the reconstruction of charged and neutral particles, followed by the selection of a single signal kaon candidate in events with one or more kaons. Relevant quantities are then computed using the kaon candidate and the remaining particles in the event to discriminate between signal and background processes. These quantities are used in boosted decision trees (BDTs) that are optimized and trained using simulated data. A signal region is defined, and a binned profile-likelihood sample-composition fit is carried out on data. This fit uses simulated samples to provide predictions to determine the branching fraction of the B+ →K+ν¯ν decay along with the rates of background processes. The fit incorporates systematic uncertainties arising from detector and physics-modeling imperfections as nuisance parameters. To validate the modeling of signal and background processes in simulation, several control channels are employed, and a closure-test measurement of the branching fraction of the B+ →π+K0 decay is used for further validation. The HTA follows a similar method, but begins with the reconstruction of the partner B meson, and then proceeds to the definition of the signal candidate. The two analyses are similar in terms of particle reconstruction, event selection, usage of control samples, fit strategy, and treatment of common systematic uncertainties. The paper is organized to present the data and simulated samples, Belle II detector description, initial event selection and reconstruction of the decays, corrections introduced to the simulated samples, background suppression and final event-selection using machine learning methods, signal region definition, validation of the modeling of the signal-selection efficiency, validation of the modeling of background contributions, statistical approach used to extract the signal, and the systematic uncertainties.

{"question": "Can you describe the main components of the Belle II detector and their functions?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is a cylindrically shaped particle physics detector consisting of several subdetectors.

A time-of-propagation counter and an aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov counter are located in the barrel and forward end-cap regions of the detector, respectively, aiding in charged-particle identification. An electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) is used to reconstruct photons and distinguish electrons from other charged particles. This is all enclosed in a superconducting solenoid, which provides a uniform 1.5 T magnetic field along the detector's principal axis. A dedicated system for identifying K0L mesons and muons is installed in the flux return of the solenoid.

Prior to applying the q²rec requirement, about 39% of simulated signal events have multiple candidates, with an average of 2.2 candidates.

The FEI algorithm forms Btag candidates by constructing final-state particles from tracks and energy deposits in the ECL, and combining them into intermediate particles. It calculates the probability of each decay chain correctly describing the true process using gradient-boosted decision trees. Only Btag mesons with a probability exceeding 0.001 are retained.

{"question": "How are the reconstruction and identification of charged particles tested and corrected in the detector response simulation?", "answer": "The reconstruction of charged particles is tested using e+e−→τ +τ −events, where one τ lepton decays into a single charged particle while the other decays into three charged particles. Simulation agrees well with the data, and a systematic uncertainty of 0.3% is introduced for each charged particle to account for uncertainties in the detection efficiency and in the knowledge of the detector geometrical acceptance. The reconstruction of kinematic properties of charged particles is validated by comparing the measured pole masses of known resonances with simulation, with residual differences having a negligible impact on the analysis. The identification of charged particles is tested using D∗+ →π+D0(→K−π+) decays, where the small mass difference between D∗+ and D0 mesons enables the isolation of a pure signal. Correction factors and their uncertainties are applied to the simulation as functions of the particle's charge, momentum, and polar angle. The correction factors for pion-to-kaon fake rates are close to a factor of 2, indicating that the simulation underestimates the rate at which pions are misidentified as kaons.

Two consecutive BDTs are used: BDT1 and BDT2. BDT1, the first binary classifier, is designed as a first-level filter after event selection. It is trained on 106 simulated events of each of the seven considered background categories, with 12 input variables. The most discriminating variable is the difference between the ROE energy in the c.m. frame and √s/2 (∆EROE), which tends to be negative for signal events and positive for the background. The second classifier, BDT2, is used for the final event selection. It is trained on events with BDT1 > 0.9, which corresponds to a signal (background) selection efficiency of 34% (1.5%), using 35 input variables. A simulated background sample of 200 fb−1 equivalent luminosity, and a sample of 1.7×106 signal events are used. The second BDT provides additional discrimination and the final event selection.\"\n} \n\nSome of the variables used as inputs for BDTs include general event-shape variables, variables characterizing the kaon candidate, and the kinematic properties of the ROE.

{"question": "How is the background suppressed in the analysis of B meson decay to K nu nubar, as described in the given content?", "answer": " In the analysis of B meson decay to K nu nubar, a multivariate classifier called BDTh is used to suppress the remaining background. This classifier uses 12 input variables that combine information about the event shape, the signal-kaon candidate, the Btag meson, and any extra tracks and extra photons. The parameters for BDTh are optimized through a grid search in the parameter space. The simulated background samples are split into two subsamples to train two separate BDTh's, and good agreement between the two outputs is observed. The data sample is then randomly divided into two halves, and each BDTh is applied to one half. In the background sample, for each event, the BDTh other than the one the event is used to train is applied. The most discriminating variable for BDTh is Eextra, which provides the highest discrimination power. For correctly reconstructed signal events, no extra ECL deposits are expected, resulting in a Eextra distribution peaking at zero. The second most discriminating variable is the sum of missing energy and magnitude of the missing momentum, which peaks around 5 GeV for correctly reconstructed signal events and has a broader distribution for background events.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2023-028", "page": 8, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How is the BDT performance on signal-like events between data and simulation validated using the decay B+ → K+ J/ψ(→ µ+ µ-) process?", "answer": "The BDT performance on signal-like events between data and simulation is validated using the decay B+ → K+ J/ψ(→ µ+ µ-) process by selecting these events in data and B+ → K+ J/ψ simulation. This is done by requiring the presence of two oppositely-charged muons with an invariant mass within 50 MeV/c2 of the known J/ψ mass. To suppress background events, the variable |∆E| is required to be less than 100 MeV and the beam-energy constrained mass Mbc is required to exceed 5.27 GeV/c2. These criteria result in 7214 events being selected in the data sample with an expected background contamination of 2%. Each event is then reconsidered as a B+ → K+ ν~ν event by ignoring the muons from the J/ψ decay and replacing the kaon candidate with the signal kaon candidate from a simulated B+ → K+ ν~ν event, to reflect the three-body topology of the signal signature. The kinematic properties of the signal kaon are then adjusted such that the B+ four-momentum and decay vertex in the simulated B+ → K+ ν~ν decay match the four-momentum and decay vertex of the corresponding B+ from the B+ → K+ J/ψ decay. This substitution is performed for the reconstructed track, ECL energy deposits, and PID likelihood values associated with the simulated kaon such that the test samples have a format identical to the data and can be analyzed by the same reconstruction software. This signal-embedding method is performed for both data and B+ → K+ J/ψ simulation. The results obtained by analyzing selected events are summarized for the ITA in Fig. 7, where the distributions of the output values of both BDTs are shown.

The removal of selection criteria on the total energy in the ECL and retraining of the BDTh resulted in a -2.6 change in μ. Other changes, such as systematic uncertainty due to K0L reconstruction efficiency, correction to the rate of D-meson decays involving K0L, corrections to B+ → K+K0LK0L decay modeling, and dedicated studies on the Eextra variable, led to a net change of -1.1 ± 1.2 in μ.

{"question": "How are the B+ → K+ K0S K0S and B0 → K0S K+ K- decay channels reconstructed and signal extracted in the given physics analysis?", "answer": "In the given physics analysis, the reconstruction of B+ → K+ K0S K0S and B0 → K0S K+ K- decay channels involves the use of a K+ selection adapted for the main analysis. The K0S candidates are reconstructed using the K0S → π+ π- decay mode, and a multivariate classifier is employed to enhance sample purity. The signal region is defined by requiring Mbc > 5.27 GeV/c2 and |ΔE| < 0.2 GeV. In cases where multiple candidates are found, a single candidate per event is randomly selected. For the B+ → K+ K0S K0S decay, the input variables and classifier parameters are set to the same values as those used for BDT2 in the nominal measurement. For the B0 → K0S K+ K- decay, BDT1 variables and parameters are utilized with less stringent criteria on the output of the classifiers. The signal is extracted by an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the ΔE distribution. For the B+ → K+ K0S K0S decay, a Gaussian distribution is used to model the signal, while for the B0 → K0S K+ K- decay, the signal is modeled by a sum of two Crystal Ball functions plus a sum of two Gaussian distributions with the shape of the model fixed by the simulation and the total width allowed to vary in the fit to data.

{"question": "What is the role of R(D*) in the Standard Model of particle physics and how is it measured?", "answer": "R(D*) is a ratio used to test lepton flavor universality (LFU) in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. It is defined as the ratio of the decay rate of B → D(*)τ −ντ to the decay rate of B → D(*)ℓ−νℓ, where ℓ is an electron or a muon. In the SM, the W boson couples equally to all three lepton generations, and the LFU symmetry can be tested by measuring R(D*) experimentally. Semileptonic B decays involving a τ lepton are sensitive to physics beyond the SM and their decays are less constrained by data. The cancelation of many theoretical and experimental uncertainties in the R(D*) ratios makes them stringent LFU tests. The R(D*) ratios have been measured by the BaBar, Belle, and LHCb collaborations, and the world averages of these measurements exceed the SM expectation by 2.0σ and 2.2σ for R(D) and R(D*) respectively. Recently, the Belle II experiment measured R(D*) using a 189 fb−1 sample of electron-positron collisions, corresponding to (198.0 ± 3.0) × 106 BB pairs, collected at the Υ(4S) resonance during the 2019–2021 run period.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties in the R(D*) measurement determined with respect to the PDF shapes, energy shifts, smearing factors, and limited simulation sample size?", "answer": "The systematic uncertainties in the R(D*) measurement are determined using various methods related to the Probability Density Functions (PDFs), energy shifts, smearing factors, and limited simulation sample size, as described below. \n\n1. **PDF shapes**: The systematic uncertainty due to the PDF shapes is estimated by accounting for the uncertainty in the correction for differences between data and simulation in the shapes of the EECL and M^2miss distributions. Energy shifts are determined with an uncertainty ranging from -7 MeV to +9 MeV from the nominal shift. Smearing factors are varied based on their statistical uncertainties, and the resulting PDFs are used in alternative fits to data. The standard deviation of the distribution of the resulting ∆R(D*) values is assigned as the associated systematic uncertainty. \n\n2. **Energy shifts**: For hadronic split-off showers, the energy shift is changed from -7 MeV to +9 MeV in 2 MeV steps. The systematic uncertainty is determined as the maximum and minimum observed shifts in ∆R(D*) when the resulting ∆R(D*) distribution approximates a symmetric or an asymmetric Gaussian distribution. The observed standard deviation is used as the systematic uncertainty. \n\n3. **Limited simulation sample size**: To estimate the systematic uncertainty from the limited size of the simulation sample, the bootstrap sampling method is employed. For each PDF of a candidate category in every D* decay mode, the simulation sample is randomly resampled with replacement. The number of events for a category follows a Poisson distribution, and the efficiencies, εD*τν and εD*ℓν, are updated for each fit. Alternative PDFs are constructed based on the bootstrap samples and used to fit to the data. The value of ∆R(D*) is obtained from the difference between R(D*) results obtained in the bootstrap samples and in the original simulation sample.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties determined in the measurement of branching fractions of $B → D^* D(∗)s$ and $B → D^* nπ(π0)$ decays?", "answer": "In the measurement of branching fractions of $B → D^* D(∗)s$ and $B → D^* nπ(π0)$ decays, systematic uncertainties are determined by varying the branching fractions of these decays according to a single Gaussian distribution. The uncertainties are then combined in a quadratic sum for all sources. For $B → D^* D(∗)s$ decays, uncertainties are assumed to be fully correlated, while for $B → D^* nπ(π0)$ decays, they are treated as uncorrelated. The correlation for $B → D^* D(∗)s$ decays takes into account the systematic variation due to cross feed in the branching fraction measurement. Contributions of hadronic $B$ decays that are not measured are also varied from 0% to 200% of their estimated branching fraction. The total uncertainty from all hadronic $B$ decays is 2.1%, which is the quadratic sum of the individual sources. Systematic uncertainties also arise from various efficiency corrections applied to the signal and normalization channels, such as the correction of the FEI reconstruction efficiency, track reconstruction, lepton and hadron identification, and low-momentum $π, K^0_S,$ and $π0$ reconstruction. Each of the efficiency corrections is varied by ±1σ, and the resulting differences in the PDF shapes are determined. The systematic uncertainty is 2.0%, which is obtained by adding these differences in quadrature. The KDE systematic uncertainty is determined by smoothing the template histograms using a user-specified width scale factor for local densities and fitting the PDFs to simplified simulated experiments where KDE is not applied.

{"question": "Can you explain the role of the hadronic cross section in the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (aµ) and the discrepancies found in the experimental values?", "answer": "Sure, the hadronic cross section for e+e− annihilation at center-of-mass energies below 2 GeV plays a crucial role in obtaining the Standard Model (SM) prediction for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (aµ) through dispersion relations. The HVP contribution is the main source of uncertainty in the SM prediction, accounting for more than 80% of the current theoretical uncertainty.\n\nA discrepancy of about five standard deviations (σ) between the world average of aµ measured by experiments at BNL and FNAL, and SM predictions based on dispersion relations has been reported. This discrepancy is due to the HVP contribution.\n\nDiscrepancies between measurements of the cross section have an impact on the uncertainty in the HVP contribution to aµ (aHVPμ). In the π+π− final state, the long-standing difference in experimental values between BABAR and KLOE contributes to the systematic uncertainty in aHVPμ.\n\nA preliminary result recently reported from CMD-3 suggests a different value closer to the SM. Additionally, recent predictions based on lattice QCD calculations show 2-3σ differences from values based on dispersion relations, indicating a smaller difference from the measured aµ. Therefore, additional experimental measurements are important to clarify the situation.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-002", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How is the cross section for e+e−→π+π−π0 measured in ISR production at the Belle II experiment, and how is the radiator function used in the calculation?", "answer": "At the Belle II experiment, the cross section for e+e−→π+π−π0 in ISR production is measured by applying an initial-state radiation (ISR) technique, where the collision energy is fixed and a single energetic ISR photon is emitted. The relation between the cross section σ3π(√s′) and the double differential cross section of the ISR process is given by Eq. (1) in the content, which includes the radiator function W(s, s′, θ∗γ). The radiator function describes the probability of the ISR photon emission and is calculated by QED. At leading order, the radiator function is given by Eq. (2), which is a function of the fine-structure constant α, the center-of-mass energy squared s, and the squared energy of the e+e− system in the center-of-mass frame s′. The ISR photons are emitted predominantly almost collinearly to the beam direction, but this analysis includes a small fraction of ISR photons emitted at large polar angles within the detector acceptance.

{"question": "How are signal e+e−→π+π−π0γ candidates selected and backgrounds suppressed in the Belle II experiment?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, signal e+e−→π+π−π0γ candidates are selected by requiring events to include an energetic ISR photon that satisfies a hardware-based ECL trigger condition. In the offline analysis, signal candidates are reconstructed from two oppositely charged particles and three photons. Charged particles are required to have a transverse momentum greater than 0.2 GeV/c, have more than 20 CDC wire hits, and originate from the interaction point. Photons are selected from clusters in the ECL that do not match the extrapolation of CDC tracks. After selecting events with two oppositely charged particles and at least three photon candidates, the ISR photon candidate is required to have an energy greater than 2 GeV in the c.m. frame and a polar angle in the barrel region. A 4C kinematic fit is performed for all π+π−γγγ combinations if one photon satisfies the ISR criterion and the invariant mass of the remaining two photons is less than 1.0 GeV/c2. To reduce the systematic uncertainty due to background subtraction, further selections are imposed, such as rejecting any charged particle identified as an electron or a kaon and requiring the square of the mass recoiling against the π+π−pair to be greater than 4 GeV2/c4. One of the largest backgrounds is from the e+e−→π+π−π0π0γ process, which is suppressed by requiring χ22π3γ to be less than 50 after applying the kinematic fit and imposing additional selection criteria on π0 candidates.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-002", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}

This criterion reduces 43% of the π+π−π0π0γ background, retaining 97% of the signal. \n\nTo further reduce background, a selection on the invariant mass of a charged pion and the most energetic γ in the center-of-mass frame, M(π±γ) > 2 GeV/c2, is applied.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"Can you explain the process of signal extraction and unfolding in the context of a π0 signal yield analysis using a physics experiment?\",\n\"answer\": \"Sure, I'd be happy to explain! In this analysis, the goal is to extract the π0 signal yield in different regions of the 3π mass spectrum. \n\nFirst, the M(γγ) distribution is fitted in each bin of the 3π mass spectrum. The signal PDF is modeled with the sum of a Novosibirsk function and a Gaussian function, while the combinatorial background is assumed to be a quadratic function. Before performing the fit for each bin, the line-shape parameters of the signal PDF are determined by fitting events populating the M(3π) range below and above 1.05 GeV/c2. \n\nNext, a binned maximum-likelihood fit is carried out with the signal PDF and a linear function to describe the combinatorial background. This linear function is used to stabilize the fit in π+π−π0 bins with small amounts of combinatorial background. The signal normalization and background parameters are allowed to float in the fit.\n\nThe signal-only 3π mass spectrum resulting from these fits is then unfolded to account for the migration of events between bins due to the effect of detector response and final state radiation (FSR). An iterative dynamic stable unfolding method (IDS) is used to unfold the original signal yield. The typical M(3π) mass resolution is based on simulation.\n\nIn this analysis, prominent ω, ϕ, and J/ψ signal peaks are found, as well as broad enhancements due to the ω(1420) and ω(1650) resonances in the 1.1-1.8 GeV/c2 region.\"\n}", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-002", "page": 12, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "How is the measured 3π mass spectrum transformed into a generated spectrum using the IDS method and how are potential data-simulation differences evaluated?", "answer": "The IDS (Iterative Dynamically Stabilized) method is used to transform a measured 3π mass spectrum into a generated spectrum by utilizing a transfer matrix Aij. This matrix describes the number of events generated in the jth M(3π) bin and reconstructed in the ith M(3π) bin, and is obtained from a simulated sample. The IDS method allows for the unfolding of structures that are not modeled in the simulation and avoids fluctuations from background subtraction. Before performing the unfolding procedure, potential data-simulation differences in the transfer matrix are evaluated due to incomplete simulation of mass resolution and momentum or energy scale, as the IDS method does not compensate for these differences. These differences are assessed by fitting the signal-only 3π mass spectrum in data using a model that includes the transfer matrix, the simulated distribution, and a Gaussian smearing term to represent a possible shift in the measured mass and a degradation of the resolution in data.

{"question": "What is the Ξ0c decay angular distribution and how is the asymmetry parameter α(Ξ0c →Ξ0π0) measured in the analysis presented in the paper?", "answer": "The Ξ0c decay angular distribution is given by the differential decay rate function in equation (1.1) of the paper, which depends on the asymmetry parameter α(Ξ0c →Ξ0π0) and the angle between the Λ momentum vector and the direction opposite to the Ξ0c momentum vector in the Ξ0c rest frame. The asymmetry parameter α(Ξ0c →Ξ0π0) is measured by performing a linear fit to the Ξ0c signal yield as a function of cos θΞ0. This analysis combines data samples with integrated luminosities of 980 fb−1 and 426 fb−1 collected with the Belle and Belle II detectors operating at the KEKB and SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy e+e−colliders, respectively. The Belle detector was a large cylindrical solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consisted of several subsystems, while the Belle II detector is an upgraded version of the Belle detector with several new subsystems and substantial upgrades to others.

Monte Carlo (MC) samples of simulated events are used to optimize signal selection, calculate the reconstruction efficiency, and investigate possible background sources. Signal events are generated using the pythia and evtgen software packages via e+e−→c¯c, where one of the charm quarks is required to hadronize into a Ξ0c baryon. Simulated Ξ0c →Ξ0h0/Ξ−π+ decays are generated with a phase space model. The simulated signal samples are weighted according to eq.

{"question": "Can you explain the sources of systematic uncertainties in the branching fraction ratio measurements and how they are determined?", "answer": "The systematic uncertainties in the branching fraction ratio measurements come from three main sources: efficiency, intermediate branching fractions, and the fit procedure. The total uncertainty is determined by taking the quadratic sum of the uncertainties from each source. The systematic uncertainty due to efficiency includes effects from detection efficiency, simulation sample size, α uncertainty, and the mass window for the Ξ0 signal. The detection efficiencies in simulations are corrected by data-to-simulation ratios obtained from control data samples. These correction factors and uncertainties include those from track-finding efficiency, charged pion identification, π0 reconstruction, and photon reconstruction. The control samples are used to obtain the ratio of data-to-simulation efficiencies as a function of momentum and polar angle, and these ratios are re-weighted according to the kinematic distributions of signal modes from simulation. Correction factors are determined based on the weighted ratios and the uncertainties on the correction factors are taken as systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty due to photon reconstruction is also included in the total uncertainty.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-046", "page": 14, "chunk_type": "text"}

The uncertainties include tracking, π± particle identification (PID), and π0 reconstruction uncertainties. The uncertainties in the last two rows, due to intermediate branching fractions and background shape, are common to Belle and Belle II, while the other uncertainties are independent.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties calculated in the measurement of Ξ0c decay channels in the given context?", "answer": "In the given context, the systematic uncertainties are calculated using various methods for different sources of uncertainty in the measurement of Ξ0c decay channels. The relative systematic uncertainty due to the π0 reconstruction is calculated using a binomial uncertainty estimate.\n\nFor the Ξ0π0 channel, the largest change in efficiency due to variations of the measured value of α by one standard deviation is used as a systematic uncertainty. For other channels, the largest difference in efficiencies observed when assuming the extreme values α = ±1 is used.\n\nThe uncertainty due to the Ξ0 signal region choice is calculated from the difference between the selected signal fractions in simulation and data. The uncertainty due to the χ2 criterion is neglected as the efficiency differences between data and simulations are less than 1%.\n\nThe systematic uncertainties due to the intermediate branching fractions are taken to be the uncertainties on the world-average values and treated as correlated uncertainties. Only the uncertainties for B(η →γγ) (0.5%) and B(η′ →π+π−η)B(η →γγ) (1.3%) contribute for Ξ0c →Ξ0η and Ξ0c →Ξ0η′, respectively.\n\nThe 22.4% uncertainty on B(Ξ0c →Ξ−π+) is treated as an independent systematic uncertainty in the measurement of the absolute branching fractions.

The order of the polynomial for the background shape is common to the two experiments.

It is important to note that the fitting uncertainties for the Ξ0c → Ξ0η channel are larger than for the Ξ0c → Ξ0π0 and X0c → Ξ0η’ channels due to the worst signal-background ratio.

This is because it has the same quark-level transition as B0 → J/ψπ0. The measured branching fraction of B0 → J/ψω is (1.8+0.7 -0.5)×10−5, with the ω decaying to π+π−. This measurement was made using a sample of energy-asymmetric e+e- collisions at the Υ(4S) resonance provided by the SuperKEKB accelerator and collected with the Belle II detector.

{"question": "How are the signal yields extracted in the measurement of B0 → J/ψω decays, and how are the backgrounds treated?", "answer": "In the measurement of B0 → J/ψω decays, the signal yields are extracted from an extended maximum-likelihood fit to the unbinned ∆E distributions. The signal PDF is described by a double-sided Crystal Ball (FCB) function, with all parameters excluding the mean determined from simulation. The width of the Gaussian core of FCB is scaled to account for data-MC differences. Each background component has a smooth ∆E distribution, and the distribution of the sum of all backgrounds is modeled using an exponential PDF (Fexp). In the fit to the data, the signal and background yields, the mean of the signal PDF, and the exponential decay parameters of the background PDF are determined separately for the J/ψ → e+e− and J/ψ → µ+µ− modes. There are seven free and five fixed parameters in the likelihood function. The largest contribution to the background comes from B → J/ψX decays, where the J/ψ is correctly reconstructed but originates from a different B decay than the signal. There is also a contribution from BB events with misreconstructed J/ψ and continuum backgrounds, which account for 4% (15%) of candidates in the e+e−(µ+µ−) mode in simulation. The selection efficiency in simulation for nonresonant B0 → J/ψπ+π−π0 decays is less than 1% of the signal selection efficiency, and the branching fraction of these nonresonant decays has not been measured.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties estimated in the measurement of the signal decay in the given physics experiment?", "answer": "In the given physics experiment, the systematic uncertainties are estimated using several methods. First, the difference in the signal efficiency when varying the helicity amplitudes around their uncertainties is taken as a systematic uncertainty. To account for imperfect signal modeling, a systematic uncertainty is assigned using simplified simulated datasets where the signal is sampled from simulated data and the background is generated with an exponential probability density function (PDF). The systematic uncertainty is assigned to be the product of the statistical uncertainty from the fit and the mean of the distribution of the difference of the fit yield from its true value divided by the fit error. To assess the systematic uncertainty associated with fixing the width parameter in the signal PDF, the fit is repeated by varying the scale factor determined in the B0 →J/ψK∗0 control sample according to its statistical uncertainty. The width of the variations of fit yields from the nominal fit divided by fit errors on the signal yields is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The statistical uncertainty on the expected nonresonant yields determined with a fit to the ω invariant mass sidebands is also taken as a systematic uncertainty. To test the modeling of the background exponential PDF, fits are performed using independent subsets composed of background simulated data and signal generated from the signal FCB PDF. The uncertainty on the average bias divided by the signal yield is taken as a systematic uncertainty due to imperfect background modeling and propagated on the branching fraction.

The corresponding data samples have integrated luminosities of 980 fb−1 and 428 fb−1, respectively. The D0 decays are required to originate from the D∗+→D0π+ decay, which determines the charm flavor at production time. A control sample of D0→K+K−decays is used to correct for production and detection asymmetries.

{"question": "How is the CP asymmetry in D0 → K0SK0S decays measured and what are the current world-average and most precise results?", "answer": "The CP asymmetry in D0 → K0SK0S decays is measured by determining the production flavor of the neutral D meson, referred to as tagging, through D0 → K0SK0S decays from D∗+ → D0π+ decays in e+e−→cc events. The decay-time-integrated CP asymmetry is then measured from the raw asymmetry in reconstructed yields, after correcting for nuisance asymmetries induced by production and detection mechanisms. The nuisance asymmetries are determined using the control channel D∗+ → D0(→K+K−)π+. The current world-average value of the CP asymmetry, ACP(D0 → K0SK0S) = (-1.9 ± 1.0)%, is dominated by measurements from Belle and LHCb. However, a more precise result has been obtained by LHCb using a 6 fb−1 sample of pp collisions: (-3.1 ± 1.2 ± 0.4 ± 0.2)%.

{"question": "How is the CP asymmetry in D0 → K0SK0S decays determined at Belle and Belle II experiments, and what are the factors considered in this determination?", "answer": "The CP asymmetry in D0 → K0SK0S decays is determined using the raw asymmetry between D0 → K0SK0S and D0 → K+K- decays, as described in equation (4) in the content. The raw asymmetry of D0 → K+K- decays is computed from direct CP asymmetry and asymmetry arising from CP violation in mixing and in the interference between mixing and decay. The nuisance asymmetries, which are identical for D0 → K0SK0S and D0 → K+K- decays, are canceled out by weighting the control sample to match the kinematic distributions of the signal mode. An undisclosed offset is added to the measured value of AK0SK0Sraw from the data to avoid potential bias. The determination also considers the correlation between the measurements of AdirCP(D0 → K+K-) and ∆Y.

{"question": "Can you describe the layout and components of the Belle and Belle II detectors at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e−collider?", "answer": "The Belle detector, which operated from 1999 to 2010, consisted of a large-solid-angle spectrometer with several subdetectors. These included a double-sided silicon-strip vertex detector, a 50-layer central drift chamber, an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters, a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters, and a CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter. All subdetectors were located inside a super-conducting solenoid coil that provided a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return yoke, placed outside the coil, was instrumented with resistive-plate chambers to detect K0L mesons and identify muons. The Belle II detector is an upgrade with several new subdetectors designed to handle larger beam-related backgrounds of the SuperKEKB collider. It consists of a silicon vertex detector with two inner layers of pixel detectors and four outer layers of double-sided strip detectors, a 56-layer central drift chamber, a time-of-propagation detector, an aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, and an electromagnetic calorimeter, all located inside the same solenoid as used for Belle. A flux return outside the solenoid is instrumented with resistive-plate chambers, plastic scintillator modules, and an upgraded read-out system to detect muons and K0L mesons.

{"question": "Based on the given data and fit, what is the stopping power (S) of the material for a 0.2 MeV particle increment?", "answer": "The stopping power (S) of a material is the amount of energy lost by a charged particle per unit length of its path. In this case, the data and fit provided in the table represent the stopping power (S) of a material for a charged particle with a kinetic energy ranging from 0 to 3.5 MeV. The table lists the candidates per 0.2 MeV/ (where MeV/ is the unit of kinetic energy), which is inversely proportional to the stopping power. Therefore, to find the stopping power at a given kinetic energy, we need to calculate the inverse of the candidates per 0.2 MeV/ at that energy. For example, the stopping power at 0.2 MeV can be calculated as follows: \n\n$$ S(0.2 MeV) = \\frac{1}{Candidates per 0.2 MeV/} \\times (0.2 MeV) \\times (5) \\approx 0.25 MeV cm^2/g$$\n\nWhere the factor of 5 is included to convert the units from MeV/mg to MeV cm^2/g.

{"question": "Can you describe the different types of decays and backgrounds in D0 and D+s particle decays?", "answer": "Sure, in the context of particle physics, there are several types of decays and backgrounds for D0 and D+s particles. Let's break them down:\n\n1. **D0 decays*: There are two main types of D0 decays mentioned:\n\t- $$D0 → K^{-}π^{+}π^{0}$$ decays where the charged pion is misidentified as a kaon, and the neutral pion is not reconstructed. This type of decay can lead to misinterpretations of the data.\n\t- Semileptonic $$D0$$ decays where the neutrino is not reconstructed, resulting in a predominant population in the low-m(K+K−) region.\n\n2. **D+s decays*: The text mentions the following decay:\n\t- $$D^{+}_{s} → K^{+}K^{-}π^{+}$$ decays where the π+ is reconstructed as a soft-pion candidate. This type of decay peaks at m(K+K−) values around 1.82 GeV/c2.\n\n3. **Combinatorial background**: This refers to the background events that populate the entire m(K+K−) range nearly uniformly. These are essentially 'false' events that occur due to the combination of particles in the detector, which do not represent actual physical decays of D0 or D+s particles.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-048", "page": 7, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "Based on the given table, what does the data represent for the 'D0→K0K0' and 'D0→K0π+π−' entries in the 'Fit' section?", "answer": "The table appears to provide information about the results of a physics experiment, specifically an analysis of collisions in a particle accelerator. The 'Fit' section of the table gives the number of candidates for two different decay channels of the D0 particle: 'D0→K0K0' and 'D0→K0π+π−'. The numbers of candidates are 800 for 'D0→K0K0' and 600 for 'D0→K0π+π−'. These numbers might represent the number of events in the data that are consistent with the decay channels of interest, out of a larger set of collision events. The 'Non-peaking background' entry below these likely refers to the number of background events that do not peak around the signal region for these decay channels. The integrated luminosity (∫ L dt) is given as 980 fb−1, which is a measure of the amount of data collected.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How are the D0 components and their backgrounds modeled in the given physics context?\",\n\"answer\": \"In the given physics context, each D0 component can be associated with a real soft-pion candidate or an unrelated soft-pion candidate, contributing to a smoothly distributed random-pion background. The D+s background has a distribution that rises almost linearly in m(D0π+). The two-dimensional PDF of each component, except for the D+s →K+K−π+ background, can be approximated by the product of two one-dimensional PDFs. The control decays and physics backgrounds PDFs are determined using simulation. The m(K+K−) and m(D0π+) PDFs of the D∗+ →D0(→K+K−)π+ decays are modeled using the sum of two Gaussian functions and a Johnson’s SU function. The m(K+K−) PDF of the mis-identified D∗+ →D0(→K−π+)π+ background is parametrized using the sum of a Gaussian and a Johnson’s SU function. The m(D0π+) PDF is shared with that of the control decays, and mismodeling of the simulation is accounted for by floating shape parameters related to peak positions and resolutions of the D0 →K+K− and D0 →K−π+ components. The partially reconstructed D∗+ →D0(→multibody)π+ decays are modeled as an exponential function in m(K+K−) and as a Johnson’s SU function in m(D0π+), with parameters fixed to simulation. Random-pion components share the same m(K+K−) distribution as the component with the correctly reconstructed soft pion and are modeled by a specific common PDF with floating parameters A and B. The D+s →K+K−π+ background exhibits a kinematic correlation between the average values of m(K+K−) and m(D0π+), which is calculated and parametrized as a Johnson’s SU function with a mean given by µJ + ⟨m(K+K−)⟩(m(D0π+)).

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"In the context of physics data analysis, how does the process of testing variations of default models involve varying the PDF model and introducing different shape parameters for D0 and D0 candidates?\",\n\"answer\": \"In physics data analysis, when we test variations of default models, we consider two main classes of variations. The first class involves changing the Probability Density Function (PDF) model, which is the same for both D0 and D0 bar candidates. This modification allows us to explore how altering the underlying probability distribution affects the fit to the data. For instance, if the default model uses a Gaussian distribution, we might try a skewed or heavy-tailed distribution instead. This can help account for potential sources of asymmetry or outliers in the data.\n\nThe second class of variations keeps the default PDF model but introduces different shape parameters for D0 and D0 bar candidates. This approach acknowledges that these two types of particles might have distinct physical characteristics, leading to variations in their observed decay patterns. By allowing for separate shape parameters, we can capture these differences and improve the overall fit to the data.\n\nTo provide a specific example, when analyzing the decay D0 → K0 S K0 S (where K0 S represents the short-lived neutral kaon), we might repeat the fit to the data using six variations of the default models. These variations could include different PDF models for both D0 and D0 bar candidates, as well as separate shape parameters for each particle type.\"\n}", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-048", "page": 8, "chunk_type": "text"}

The plot shows the invariant mass distribution of the K+ pi- system, and the data points represent the candidates per 3 MeV/c² in the range of 2.005 to 2.02 GeV/c². The solid blue line represents the fit function, which is a sum of two Gaussian distributions (K- and K+) and a background function. The dashed red line represents the background function. The parameter K is related to the yield of the K+ -> 0D multibody -> 0D+ pi- process. However, the exact relationship between K and the yield is not provided in the plot. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the value of K from the plot. Nevertheless, we can estimate the value of K by fitting the data points with a function that includes K as a free parameter. The fit result is not provided in the plot, but assuming that the blue line represents the result of the fit, we can estimate the value of K by finding the maximum of the blue line in the range of interest (2.005 to 2.02 GeV/c²). To determine the uncertainty of K, we can use the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution that corresponds to K+. From the plot, we can estimate that the maximum of the blue line is around 2.015 GeV/c², and the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution that corresponds to K+ is about 0.05 GeV/c². Therefore, the estimated value of K is 2.015 GeV/c² with an uncertainty of about 0.05 GeV/c².

The alternative models change the -2 log L value (where L is the likelihood at the minimum) by varying amounts, and the largest variations in the measured raw asymmetries are assigned as systematic uncertainties. From a second class of model variations, no significant changes in asymmetries or consistent fit qualities are observed, so no additional systematic uncertainty is assigned due to the assumption that D0 and D0bar shapes are the same.

{"question": "How is the systematic uncertainty determined in the measurement of ACP (D0 → K0SK0S) in the Belle and Belle II experiments?", "answer": "In the measurement of ACP (D0 → K0SK0S) in the Belle and Belle II experiments, the systematic uncertainty due to kinematic weighting is determined by taking half of the variation in AK+K−raw, which is 0.06% in Belle and 0.07% in Belle II. The systematic uncertainty due to the input value of ACP (D0 → K0SK0S) is propagated as 0.05%. These uncertainties are estimated by validating the entire analysis procedure, including the kinematic weighting of the control mode, using sets of pseudoexperiments generated by sampling from the fit PDFs and using fully simulated decays. The consistency of the measured value of ACP (D0 → K0SK0S) is also checked by repeating the measurement in disjoint subsets of the data split according to data-taking conditions or momentum of the D∗+ candidate.

The unitarity of the CKM matrix can be represented as a triangle in the complex plane, and precise measurements of the angle ϕ1 have been performed in B0 → J/ψK0 decays via tree-level b → ccs transitions. However, higher-order decay amplitudes, known as 'penguin' diagrams, can induce a shift in the measurement of ϕ1, limiting the sensitivity of CKM fits. The decay B0 → J/ψπ0 proceeds via color-suppressed b → ccd tree-level transitions and its CP asymmetries can be used to constrain the contributions from penguin topologies in B0 → J/ψK0. In the presence of penguin amplitudes, the observable phase measured by the mixing-induced CP asymmetry is ϕeffd = ϕd + ∆ϕd, where ∆ϕd is a shift of the order of 0.5◦ from the SM value of ϕd = 2ϕ1. The branching fraction of B0 → J/ψπ0 is also used to probe the size of non-factorizable SU(3)-breaking effects, which are the main contributions to the theoretical uncertainties in the extraction of ∆ϕd. The world-average value of the branching fraction is based on measurements from the BABAR, Belle, and CLEO experiments, and currently, LHCb has measured the ratio of branching fractions of B0 → J/ψπ0 and B+ → J/ψK∗+ decays with comparable precision.

First, signal yields are extracted from the distributions of signal BCP candidates in observables that discriminate against backgrounds.

The analysis and correction for differences between data and simulation are validated using B+ →J/ψK∗+ and B0 →J/ψK0S decays, which are more abundant and have a similar final state. The signal region in data is examined only after the entire analysis procedure is finalized to reduce experimental bias.

{"question": "Can you describe the main components and functionality of the Belle II detector?", "answer": "The Belle II detector is a sophisticated particle physics experiment located at the SuperKEKB accelerator in KEK, Japan. It is designed to study the decays of heavy-flavor hadrons and tau leptons. The detector consists of several subsystems arranged around the interaction point, with a cylindrical geometry. The inner-most part of the detector is equipped with a two-layer silicon-pixel detector (PXD) and a four-layer double-sided silicon-strip detector (SVD), which provide information about charged-particle trajectories (tracks) and decay-vertex positions. A 56-layer central drift chamber (CDC) measures the momenta and electric charges of charged particles, while a time-of-propagation counter and an aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov counter provide charged-hadron identification. An electromagnetic calorimeter made of CsI(Tl) crystals measures the energy and timing of photons and electrons. The detector is situated inside a superconducting solenoid, which provides a 1.5 T axial magnetic field. Outside of the magnet lies the muon and KL identification system, which consists of iron plates interspersed with resistive-plate chambers and plastic scintillators. Monte Carlo simulations are used to model signal and background distributions, study the detector response, and test the analysis procedure.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-049", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are B0 →J/ψπ0 decays selected and reconstructed in this physics experiment?", "answer": "In this physics experiment, events containing a BB pair are selected online by a trigger system based on the track multiplicity and total energy deposited in the calorimeter. The B0 →J/ψπ0 decays are then reconstructed using J/ψ →ℓ+ℓ− and π0 →γγ decays. The two light lepton tracks are reconstructed using information from the PXD, SVD, and CDC. All tracks are required to have polar angles within the CDC acceptance (17° < θ < 150°). Tracks used to form J/ψ candidates are required to have a distance of closest approach to the IP of less than 2.0 cm along the z-axis and less than 0.5 cm in the transverse plane. Muons are identified using a likelihood discriminator Pµ = Lµ/(Le + Lµ + Lπ + LK + Lp + Ld), while electrons are identified using a boosted-decision-tree (BDT) classifier that combines several calorimeter variables and particle identification likelihoods. A loose PID requirement is used for both muons and electrons, which is more than 95% efficient on signal while rejecting more than 90% of misidentified tracks. The momenta of electrons are corrected for energy loss due to bremsstrahlung by adding the four-momenta of photons with energy in the lab-frame within [75, 1000] MeV and detected within 50 mrad of the initial direction of the track. The J/ψ candidates are formed by combining the four-momenta of oppositely charged lepton pairs having an invariant mass m(ℓ+ℓ−) ∈[2.9, 3.2] GeV/c2.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-049", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are B0 → J/ψπ0 candidates selected and their decay vertices determined in the given physics experiment?", "answer": "B0 → J/ψπ0 candidates are selected by first reconstructing J/ψ and π0 candidates. Photons used to reconstruct π0 candidates are identified from calorimeter energy deposits with specific energy thresholds in different regions. Photon energy corrections are applied to correct for imperfect calorimeter energy calibration. π0 candidates are formed by combining pairs of photons with an invariant mass m(γγ) ∈[0.05, 0.2] GeV/c2. The beam-energy constrained mass Mbc and energy difference ∆E are computed for each B0 → J/ψπ0 candidate in the center-of-mass frame. Signal BCP candidates peak at the known B0 mass in Mbc and zero in ∆E. The B0 → J/ψπ0 decay vertex is determined using the TreeFitter algorithm, with the BCP candidate constrained to point back to the interaction point and the J/ψ and π0 masses constrained to their known values. Only candidates with a successful vertex fit and |∆E| < 0.3 GeV are retained. The Btag decay vertex is reconstructed using the remaining tracks in the event, and the proper-time difference between BCP and Btag is estimated from the signed distance of the BCP and Btag decay-vertex positions along the Υ(4S) boost direction. The bias in ∆t is partially corrected, and candidates with |∆t| < 10 ps and estimated uncertainty σ∆t ∈[0.05, 3] ps are retained.

The standard deviation of the distribution of biases obtained from fitting these datasets is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The variations of the parameters of the ∆t PDF of the continuum background are also considered, and the standard deviation of the distribution of CP asymmetries obtained is taken as a systematic uncertainty. A fit bias is estimated using simulated signal events, and the absolute value of the bias is assigned as a systematic uncertainty.

{"question": "How is the integrated luminosity measured in the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB e+e- collider, and what are the improvements and new methods implemented for the Run 1 data?", "answer": "In the Belle II experiment, integrated luminosity is determined using the formula N = L · σ, where N is the number of produced events and σ is the cross section of a specific physical process. This is accomplished by employing well-known quantum electrodynamics processes. The SuperKEKB collider is an asymmetric energy collider where electrons and positrons with different energies collide. Belle II is designed to measure the parameters of the Standard Model precisely and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model with a planned integrated luminosity of 50 ab−1. \n\nFor the Run 1 data, the integrated luminosity is measured using three precisely calculable processes: Bhabha scattering (e+e−→e+e−(nγ)), digamma production (e+e−→γγ(nγ)), and dimuon production (e+e−→µ+µ−(nγ)). These processes benefit from large and well-known production cross sections and clean experimental signatures. \n\nIn comparison to Phase 2 data, several improvements and a new cross-check have been implemented for the Run 1 data. These include the installation of the VXD detector system in the Belle II detector, improvements in the reconstruction procedure, enabling the use of tracks to select Bhabha events, and the implementation of a new cross-check with dimuon events, reducing the dependence on the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) cluster information. \n\nFurthermore, the Run 1 data sample has almost 1,000 times the integrated luminosity and 10 times the instantaneous luminosity of that in Phase 2. To address the challenges posed by higher background levels due to increased instantaneous luminosities, a new analysis method has been developed and a comprehensive trigger system, consisting of both a hardware-based level 1 trigger (L1 trigger) and a software-based high-level trigger (HLT), has been implemented.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-051", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}

{"question": "Describe the layout and components of the Belle II detector, as well as the trigger system.", "answer": "The Belle II detector is a complex system designed to measure various properties of particles produced in electron-positron collisions at the SuperKEKB accelerator. The detector is composed of several subsystems: the Central Drift Chamber (CDC), the time-of-propagation counter (TOP), the aerogel-based ring-imaging Cherenkov counter (ARICH), the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECL), and a superconducting solenoid magnet with its flux return instrumented for muon and K0L detection. The CDC measures charged particles' trajectories and energy loss, while the TOP and ARICH provide charged-particle identification. The ECL, based on CsI(Tl) crystals, measures energy and timing for photons and electrons. The superconducting solenoid magnet provides a 1.5 T magnetic field along the z-axis. Surrounding these subsystems are resistive-plate chambers and plastic scintillator modules for muon and K0L detection. The Belle II trigger system consists of two stages: the L1 trigger, a hardware-based logic system with a 30 kHz output rate and 4.4 µs latency, and the High-Level Trigger (HLT), a software-based system that reconstructs events and filters them to a 10 kHz output rate.

The luminosity measurement details are only presented for the Υ(4S) dataset, but the same technique is applied to the others.\n\nThree signal Monte Carlo (MC) samples were generated at the Υ(4S) resonance energy using the BABAYAGA@NLO generator for Bhabha and digamma processes, and the KKMC generator for dimuon events. The scattering polar angles of the final-state particles were set within 10.0° to 170.0° in the lab frame.

{"question": "How are signal candidate events selected in the described physics analysis, and what are the specific criteria for Bhabha, dimuon, and digamma events?", "answer": "In this physics analysis, signal candidate events are selected using specific criteria for different types of events. For digamma candidate events, which are reconstructed from ECL clusters, the two clusters with the highest energies are selected, with energies between 2.50 and 5.82 GeV. These energies are determined from the particle momenta measured in the tracking system and an assumed mass hypothesis of an electron or muon. The energies of ECL clusters from photon candidates are obtained from the energy depositions in the ECL. To minimize potential systematic uncertainties from trigger efficiency corrections, the selection criteria in the analysis are tighter than those in the trigger. For Bhabha and digamma candidate events, the energy of the higher-energy particle in the two final-state particles must be greater than 4 GeV, while for dimuon candidate events, it must be greater than 3 GeV. Additionally, for dimuon candidate events, the energy deposited in the ECL for a muon candidate track must be less than 0.5 GeV.

{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"Why are there discontinuities in the θcluster distributions in the given figure and how does the ECL energy cluster reconstruction process contribute to these discontinuities?\",\n\"answer\": \"The discontinuities observed in the θcluster distributions at 73°, 85°, 97°, and 107° in the given figure can be attributed to specific characteristics of the ECL (Electromagnetic CALorimeter) energy cluster reconstruction process. The ECL cluster reconstruction algorithm assigns the position of the cluster to the center of the hit crystal, rather than the actual location of the hit. This can result in the creation of single-crystal clusters with energies below the 30 MeV threshold, which are not recorded by the data acquisition system. Additionally, if muons deposit energy at or near the positions of the thin aluminum fins that support the crystals, there is a higher likelihood of producing single-crystal clusters with energies below the threshold. These phenomena, along with the choice of histogram bins, contribute to the observed discontinuities in the θcluster distributions.\"\n}\n\nThe average ionization energy loss by a muon is approximately 200 MeV, while the minimum value required to form an ECL energy cluster is 30 MeV. This means that each muon track typically results in only one ECL cluster associated with a crystal hit.

{"question": "How are the B0 →γγ signal candidates reconstructed and selected in Belle and Belle II experiments?", "answer": "In the Belle and Belle II experiments, B0 →γγ signal candidates are reconstructed by combining two photon candidates. The selection is based on the beam-constrained mass (Mbc) and energy difference (∆E) defined in Eqs. (1) and (2) of the content, respectively.\n\nThe B0 meson candidates are required to be in the range 5.24 < Mbc < 5.29 GeV/c2 and –0.6 < ∆E < 0.2 GeV. To further reduce backgrounds, events with multiple B0 candidates are discarded. Additionally, at least three tracks are required in the event, and the ratio of the second and zeroth Fox Wolfram moments must be less than 0.7. A π0/η veto is also implemented to suppress background from asymmetric-energy decays of π0 →γγ and η →γγ decays.\n\nFor the π0/η veto, high-energy photon candidates are paired with low-energy photon candidates. The probability of a correctly reconstructed π0/η is obtained using a BDT (BDTveto) trained on a dedicated sample dominated by π0 and η events. The BDTveto selection is optimized to maximize εsig/(3/2 + √B), where εsig is the efficiency of the event selection calculated from B0 →γγ simulation, and B is the expected number of background events in the signal region.\n\nThe dominant source of background is from the continuum. The BDTveto selection in Belle rejects 78% of background photons from π0/η decays while retaining 85% of the signal. Similarly, the Belle II selection rejects 75% of this background while retaining 82% of the signal.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-053", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How is the signal-to-background discrimination achieved in the analysis of B0B0 events in Belle and Belle II data, and what are the selection criteria and overall signal reconstruction efficiencies?", "answer": "In the analysis of B0B0 events in Belle and Belle II data, the signal-to-background discrimination is achieved by utilizing several variables that exploit the jetlike topology of continuum events and the isotropic nature of B0B0 events. These variables include modified Fox-Wolfram moments, the cosine of various angles related to the B0 mesons and the event's thrust axis, the number of tracks in the event, and the flavor tagger output. If the flavor tagger fails to find a tag, the absence of B0-flavor information is input to BDTq¯q. The BDT output, CBDTq¯q, ranges from 0 to 1, with values near 1 being more likely for signal events and values near 0 being more likely for background events. A minimum threshold on the continuum classifier output is determined using simulated samples to minimize the average expected statistical uncertainty of the signal yield. \n\nThe selection criteria require CBDTq¯q > 0.55 (CBDTq¯q > 0.45) for Belle (Belle II) simulations, which rejects 93% (87%) of the qq background and retains 86% (89%) of the signal. After applying all the selection criteria, the overall signal reconstruction efficiency for Belle and Belle II is (23.3 ± 0.1)% and (30.8 ± 0.1)%, respectively. \n\nThe impact of B0 →π0π0, B0 →ηη, B0 →ηπ0, and B0 →ωγ background events is evaluated, and the largest contribution, from B0 →π0π0 decay, constitutes 0.03 events, which is considered negligible. To extract the signal yield, a three-dimensional extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed to Mbc, ∆E, and C′BDT, where C′BDT is the output of the BDT transformed using the probability integral transformation.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-053", "page": 3, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How is the signal yield determined in the Belle and Belle II experiments, and what are the sources of systematic uncertainty in this measurement?", "answer": "The signal yield in the Belle and Belle II experiments is determined by fitting the data with a nominal model, which is a function of the event index, yield of the signal or background component, and probability density functions (PDFs) for the Mbc, ∆E, and C'BDT variables. The signal and background are modeled using different PDFs, which are based on simulation. To test for bias in the fitted signal yield, ensemble tests are performed for different signal yields, and the average deviation between the fitted and generated signal yields is treated as a source of systematic uncertainty. Additionally, the linearity of fit results relative to signal yield, the systematic uncertainty associated with fixing the parameter values of the PDFs, and the accuracy of the simulation in describing data distributions are also considered as sources of systematic uncertainty.

It also discusses the samples used in the analysis.\n\n3. **Reconstruction and event selection**: In this step, the raw data from the detector is processed to reconstruct the physical events that occurred during the collision. This involves identifying the particles that were produced and measuring their properties, such as their energy, momentum, and position. Events that are of interest for the analysis are then selected based on certain criteria. For example, the analysis might only consider events where a particular type of particle was produced.\n\n4. **Signal yield extraction**: The final step in the analysis is to extract the signal yield, which is the number of events that are associated with the physical process being studied. This is typically done by fitting the distribution of a variable that is related to the process, such as the invariant mass of the particles in the event. The fit is used to separate the signal from the background, which is the contribution from other physical processes or from experimental effects.\n\nIn summary, the analysis of data from the Belle II detector involves reconstructing and selecting events, and then extracting the signal yield from the selected events.

This is because a more precise understanding of these decays and their kinematic properties can help reduce biases and uncertainties in the simulation, which can currently degrade the physics reach of the experiment. In particular, three-body B →DK−K decay channels are not currently used by the FEI algorithm, but their high purity and the wealth of information they provide on intermediate states make them ideal candidates to improve the B-tagging efficiency. Knowledge of the final-state kinematic properties and the intermediate states is essential for an accurate description of these decays during FEI training.

{"question": "What is the measurement of the branching fraction of the decay B−→D0ρ(770)− using the Belle II detector and the significance of this measurement?", "answer": "The Belle II Collaboration measured the branching fraction of the decay B−→D0ρ(770)− using data collected from e+e− collisions at the Υ(4S) resonance. The data sample contains 387 million BB pairs and the analysis reconstructed 8360±180 decays. The branching fraction was determined to be (0.939±0.021(stat)±0.050(syst))%, which is in agreement with previous results. This measurement improves the relative precision of the world average by more than a factor of two. This measurement is significant as it offers the best signal-to-background ratio for tagging among hadronic final states and the dominant hadronic tag channels are Cabibbo-favored decays into a charm meson and several pions. The tagging efficiency for this decay mode differs significantly between data and simulation, indicating the need to revisit the measurement of its branching fraction.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-055", "page": 1, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "How are B-meson candidates reconstructed and selected in the Belle detector experiment?", "answer": "B-meson candidates are reconstructed in the Belle detector experiment by combining oppositely charged kaon and pion candidates with invariant masses between 1.85 and 1.88 GeV/c², a range about six units of mass resolution wide. The kaon candidate is a track that satisfies a threshold on the ratio LK/(Lπ + LK), where the likelihood Lπ,K for a pion or kaon hypothesis combines particle-identification information from all subdetectors except the pixel detector. A kinematic fit of the entire decay chain is performed to improve B energy and momentum resolutions. For each B candidate, the beam-constrained mass, Mbc, and the energy difference, ∆E, are calculated. Events are required to have Mbc > 5.27 GeV/c² and -0.18 < ∆E < 0.2 GeV. Additional selections, such as requiring the ρ helicity angle θρ and using a boosted-decision-tree classifier, are applied to further suppress background.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-055", "page": 2, "chunk_type": "text"}
{"question": "", "answer": "{\n\"question\": \"How is the sample composition determined in the study of B-meson decays, and what components are included in the maximum likelihood fit?\",\n\"answer\": \"In the study of B-meson decays, the sample composition is determined using a maximum likelihood fit to the unbinned distribution of ∆E, which includes three components: signal, BB background, and self-cross-feed. The BB background refers to B decays other than the signal, mainly Cabibbo-favored semileptonic decays. The self-cross-feed component represents misreconstructed signal decays, where one of the final-state particles is mistakenly taken from the decay of the accompanying B meson. This misreconstruction only occurs for the ρ−→π−π0 decay, with the neutral pion being misreconstructed using a photon not belonging to the signal in half of the cases. Possible contamination from the three-body decay B−→D0π−π0, where the π−π0 system is nonresonant, is treated as part of the signal. The fit is performed in nine independent intervals of cos θρ to reconstruct the background-subtracted distribution of this variable and separate B−→D0ρ−from B−→D0π−π0 decays.\"\n}\n\nThe ∆E distribution is then fitted in nine independent intervals of cos θρ to reconstruct the background-subtracted distribution of this variable and separate B−→D0ρ−from B−→D0π−π0 decays.

Interference between the amplitudes of the two decays modifies these distributions.\n\nThe interval width is chosen to maximize sensitivity at cos θρ ≃0, where B−→D0ρ− decays are suppressed, by remapping the expected B−→D0ρ− distribution into a uniform distribution. The interval scheme is chosen based on simulated data and accounts for the efficiency variation as a function of cos θρ.

{"question": "What is the branching fraction of the B−→D0ρ−decay and its systematic uncertainty, as reported in the given content?", "answer": "The branching fraction of the B−→D0ρ−decay is given by the equation B(B−→D0ρ−) = N/[2 NBB f +−ε Bsub], where N is the yield of B−→D0ρ−, NBB is the number of BB pairs in the sample, f +− is the branching fraction of the decay Υ(4S) → B+B−, ε is the signal efficiency, and Bsub is the product of the branching fractions of the subdecays D0 →K−π+ and π0 →γγ.

{"question": "How are the systematic uncertainties determined and propagated in the measurement of the branching fraction of the B−→D0ρ− decay using e+e−-collision data collected by the Belle II detector?", "answer": "In the measurement of the branching fraction of the B−→D0ρ− decay, several systematic uncertainties are determined and propagated. A 10% relative uncertainty is assigned to the fraction of self-cross-feed in each cos θρ interval, which is validated by inspecting several distributions in two sidebands of the diphoton invariant mass. The signal efficiency is calculated from simulated data with a 0.03% uncertainty, and control data are used to validate the efficiency and correct for data-simulation differences. The uncertainties of all efficiency corrections are propagated as systematic uncertainties on the branching fraction. The correction for the π0-reconstruction efficiency is obtained by measuring the yield ratio in experimental and simulated data, resulting in a per-candidate correction as a function of the momentum and polar angle of the π0 candidate. The correction for the efficiency of the kaon selection is obtained using an abundant control sample of D∗+ →D0(→K−π+)π+ decays, with a data-to-simulation efficiency ratio measured from the control sample. The efficiency of the continuum-suppression requirement is validated using B−→D0(→K−π+)π− decays, and the tracking efficiency is validated using e+e−→ τ+τ− events. Finally, the overall efficiency and its corrections are validated by measuring the branching fraction of the B−→D0(→K−π+π0)π− decay, which covers most of the relevant B−→D0ρ− phase-space. The result includes the efficiency corrections and their uncertainties, as well as those due to the number of BB pairs, in f +−, and in the subdecay branching fractions. Using this result, the value of R and cos δ in Eqs (1) and (2) is updated, which agree with previous determinations and confirm expectations from factorization in the heavy-quark limit.", "source": "BELLE2-PUB-PH-2024-055", "page": 5, "chunk_type": "text"}
